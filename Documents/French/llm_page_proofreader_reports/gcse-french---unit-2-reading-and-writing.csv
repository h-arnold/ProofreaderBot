0,6,things that they must and must not do,"- information for candidates, which tells candidates about **things that they must and must not do** when they are completing the assessment",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,"The phrasing is verbose and less formal than expected for a professional educational document; it could be more concise and professional (e.g., 'obligations and restrictions')."
1,7,they describe,"The theme of travel is strongest as **they describe** different means of transport and travel, however different events and activities also lean towards leisure.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The pronoun 'they' lacks a clear and logical antecedent; the story or theme, rather than the means of transport, would be the subject describing these elements."
2,7,"fantasy, however there","The main theme is wellbeing, with emphasis on imagination and **fantasy, however there** are also clear links between Wales and Brittany.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,This is a comma splice; 'however' is used to join two independent clauses without a semicolon or full stop.
3,8,Film transcript,#### **Film transcript:**,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,95,"The document consistently refers to this genre as 'film script' elsewhere (e.g., page 7 and page 9), so 'Film transcript' is inconsistent."
4,8,example relationships,"The film deals with the theme of wellbeing, for **example relationships** and school life.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,A comma is required after the introductory phrase 'for example'.
5,8,evidences,This is a comedy which **evidences** the stereotypes of northern and southern France.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,"While grammatically correct, 'shows' or 'illustrates' would be more natural and stylistically appropriate in this context."
6,9,1 hour 15% of qualification 45 marks,The assessment lasts for **1 hour 15% of qualification 45 marks**,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"This sentence is a run-on, listing multiple facts without proper punctuation or conjunctions to separate them; it should be structured as a list or with appropriate punctuation (e.g., semicolons)."
7,9,internet,"Where tasks are produced digitally, online dictionaries, spelling and grammar checking programmes and access to **internet** must be disabled.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,95,'Internet' as a proper noun referring to the global network should be capitalised.
8,9,"(1a), 70 words and task (1b) 130 words","The task requires learners to complete a response with a maximum of 200 words (task **(1a), 70 words and task (1b) 130 words**) in the assessed language, based on the study of the chosen work.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The phrasing is slightly awkward; clearer alternatives would be 'task (1a) (70 words) and task (1b) (130 words)' or 'task (1a) of 70 words and task (1b) of 130 words'.
9,9,written language in writing,The assessment is based on the candidate's ability to understand and respond to **written language in writing**.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,"The phrase 'in writing' is redundant when referring to responding to 'written language', as the act of responding to written language typically implies a written response."
10,11,is summarised,The acceptable formats for evidence of each of the tasks **is summarised** in the task tables.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,The plural subject 'formats' requires the plural verb 'are summarised' for correct subject-verb agreement.
11,11,Candidate's work,The form must be completed and securely attached to the **Candidate's work** and sent to the awarding body.,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"The term 'candidate' is used in lowercase elsewhere in the document (e.g., 'candidate cover sheet', 'candidate declaration form'); therefore, 'Candidate's work' should be 'candidate's work' for consistency."
12,15,workjustify,(b) Write a review of the work you have studied.<br>You must:<br>provide examples of what you liked about the **workjustify** your opinions.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The words 'work' and 'justify' are merged, indicating missing punctuation (e.g., a semicolon or a conjunction and comma) to separate the two distinct instructions."
13,15,internet,"Where tasks are produced digitally, online dictionaries, spelling and grammar checking programmes and access to **internet** must be disabled.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,90,"For formal British English, 'Internet' should be capitalised as it is a proper noun, and the definite article 'the' is typically used before it (e.g., 'access to the Internet')."
14,16,specialists they,"Markers are highly experienced subject **specialists they** may have read the source you are using, or even marked the work you have copied from!",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,"Two independent clauses are joined without appropriate punctuation or a conjunction, creating a comma splice."
15,17,"must,","Where you have used AI tools as a source of information, you **must**, retain a copy of the question(s) and computer-generated content for reference and authentication purposes, in a noneditable format (such as a screenshot) and provide a brief explanation of how it has been used.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,A comma should not separate the modal verb 'must' from the main verb 'retain'.
16,18,allowed,I confirm that the evidence submitted for assessment has been produced by me without any assistance beyond that **allowed**,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,99,The sentence is missing a full stop at its conclusion.
17,19,however;,Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (**however;** the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen).,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,A semicolon is incorrectly used after 'however' when it functions as a conjunctive adverb introducing a subordinate clause; a comma is required.
18,19,adopting the approach of penalising candidates for any omissions,"It should be remembered that candidates are writing under examination conditions and credit should be given for what the candidate writes, rather than **adopting the approach of penalising candidates for any omissions**.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,"The phrasing is verbose and could be made more concise for better flow and clarity (e.g., 'rather than penalising candidates for omissions')."
19,19,'Credit any other valid response.',The inclusion of **'*Credit any other valid response.*'** (or similar instruction) within mark schemes allows for the possible variation in candidates' responses.,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"Single apostrophes are used instead of standard double quotation marks for a direct quote, which is inconsistent with typical formal document style and the general expectation for direct quotes in British English."
20,19,in two parts;,For band marked questions mark schemes are **in two parts;** the indicative content and the assessment grid.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,A colon is stylistically preferred before a list of items introduced by a phrase like 'in two parts' for improved clarity.
21,20,descriptors most closely matches,"If the descriptors at the lowest band are satisfied, examiners should move up to the next band and repeat this process for each band until the **descriptors most closely matches** the work.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,"Subject-verb agreement error: 'descriptors' is plural, so the verb should be 'match' not 'matches'."
22,20,rather that,"Marking should be positive, rewarding achievement **rather that** penalising failure or omissions.",ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,99,Typographical error: 'that' should be 'than' in the phrase 'rather than'.
23,20,during standardising,Standardising material that has already been awarded a mark will be provided **during standardising** and this should be used as a reference material when assessing work.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The noun form 'standardisation' should be used here instead of the gerund 'standardising' for grammatical correctness in this context.
24,20,is appropriate,Examiners are reminded of the need to revisit the standardising material as they apply the mark scheme in order to confirm that the band and the mark allocated **is appropriate** to the work submitted.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,"Subject-verb agreement error: 'the band and the mark' is a compound subject, requiring the plural verb 'are appropriate'."
25,20,'model answer',"This is not a checklist for expected content in an answer, or set out as a **'model answer'**, as responses must be marked in the banded levels of response provided for each question.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"Single apostrophes are used for a direct quote, which is inconsistent with the expected use of double quotation marks for direct quotes in formal British English documents, and with the general style of the document."
26,20,and reward as directed,"Where a candidate provides a response that contains aspects or approaches not included in the indicative content, examiners should use their professional judgement to determine the validity of the response in light of the task **and reward as directed** by the bands.",ErrorCategory.AMBIGUOUS_PHRASING,80,The phrasing 'and reward as directed' creates a slight ambiguity regarding whether 'reward' is parallel to 'determine' or if it's an imperative. Adding 'to' before 'reward' or rephrasing would improve clarity.
27,21,band marked questions / banded mark questions / banded mark schemes,For **band marked questions** mark schemes are in two parts; the indicative content and the assessment grid. The marking of **banded mark questions** should always be positive. The following glossary of terms provides guidance on terms used within the **banded mark schemes**.,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"Inconsistent use of 'band marked' and 'banded mark' as compound adjectives throughout the document. A consistent form (e.g., 'band-marked' or 'banded mark') should be chosen and applied."
28,21,and or the tense,Incorrect verb forms resulting in confusion about the subject **and or the tense**:,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,90,'and or' should be written as 'and/or' for clarity and standard formal usage.
29,21,different to English,• word order that is **different to English**.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,75,"While 'different to' is acceptable in British English, 'different from' is often preferred for clarity and grammatical precision."
30,22,example: frequent,"Please note that these should be viewed in conjunction with the descriptor as they may not always go from top to lower, for **example: frequent** errors would be in a lower mark band.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,A comma is required after 'for example' when it introduces an explanatory phrase or clause.
31,23,specification*.,AO3 Demonstrate knowledge and accurate application of the grammar and vocabulary prescribed in the **specification*.**,ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,95,"The asterisk is an extraneous character, likely an OCR artifact, and should be removed."
32,23,conveyed.Responses,Consistently relevant information is **conveyed.Responses** are always extended and consistently developed.Communication is clear and consistently understandable.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,A space is required after a full stop separating two sentences. This error recurs multiple times within the assessment grid table cells on this page.
33,24,"used, little","• Some appropriate vocabulary and structures are **used, little**<br>complex language.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,"The phrasing 'used, little complex language' is awkward; adding a preposition like 'with' would improve flow and grammatical clarity in this descriptive bullet point."

45,28,control,Unit 2 **control** the level of supervision is **Direct**. **Please note that this assessment must be taken in one single session and must not exceed the allotted one hour.**,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The singular subject 'Unit 2' requires the verb 'controls' for subject-verb agreement.
