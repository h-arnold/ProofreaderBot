#### <span id="page-6-0"></span>Assessment details

For this assessment learners are required to investigate a business that operates in their locality. The business they investigate can be a local scale business only operating in the locality or a national or global business that has a presence in the locality.

Learners will be required to undertake research on their chosen business and to use their research findings to produce a report. Part A of the report will be compulsory, but for part B WJEC will select two themes from the specification content (Business ethics, Business and the environment and Business and Technology) and centres and/or learners will choose **one** of the selected themes.

The assignment, featuring the two selected themes and the associated tasks, will be released during the first week of September for assessment for that academic year and will change annually. Centres have the flexibility to decide when, during the assessment year, learners undertake the assignment.

This assessment contributes to 15% of the overall qualification grade and will take 5 hours to complete. The assignment could be completed in one sitting, or in multiple, shorter sessions. The assignment will be marked out of a total of 48 marks.

This unit will be assessed through an externally set assignment and will be set and marked by WJEC. Assessments must be submitted digitally (they may be hand written and scanned, or completed digitally).

The two themes selected each year from the specification content are shown below:

| Year of<br>submission | Choice of theme<br>(Centres and/or candidates to select one from<br>the selected themes) |                                 |

| 2029                  | Ethics                                                                                   | Business and the<br>environment |

Centres and/or candidates select **one** theme from the two above to answer Part B of Task 2.

It is important that centres select the topic from the year that they plan to submit the work for marking as this may be different to the year that the candidates undertake the assessment.

This candidate assessment pack is for candidates completing Unit 2 – Key Business Considerations.

Within this pack, you will find:

- information for candidates, which tells you about things that you must and must not do when you are completing the assessment

Your teacher is allowed to help you to understand the assessment requirements and the tasks, but there are rules about the kind of help and how much they can give you. You should speak to your teacher if you have any questions about what you are and are not allowed to do as you are completing the tasks, as they will know how much help they are allowed to give you.

It is important that you work independently from other candidates and the work produced should be your own unaided work. You and your teacher will be required to sign a declaration that all work presented is your own work.

You are advised to check your work carefully to make sure that it is accurate and correct.

#### Information for candidates

The following information has been taken from the [JCQ Information for candidates](https://www.jcq.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IFC-NE_Assessments_2021_v4.pdf) – non[examination assessments](https://www.jcq.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IFC-NE_Assessments_2021_v4.pdf) and the [JCQ Artificial Intelligence \(AI\) Use in Assessments:](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice/artificial-intelligence/)  [Protecting the Integrity of Qualifications.](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice/artificial-intelligence/) This tells you about things that you **must** and **must not** do when you are completing your assessment. If there is anything that you do not understand, you **must** ask your teacher.

#### **Preparing your work**

- When you submit your work and sign your candidate declaration form, you need to ensure that your final product reflects your own independent work and isn't copied or paraphrased from another source such as an AI tool.
- If you receive help and guidance from someone other than your teacher, you **must** tell your teacher who will then record the nature of the assistance given to you.
- If you worked as part of a group on a task, you **must** each write up your own account of the assignment. Even if the data you have is the same, you **must** describe in your own words how that data was obtained, and you **must** independently draw your own conclusions from the data.
- Take care of your work and keep it safe. **Do not** leave it lying around where your classmates can find it or share it with anyone, including posting it on social media. You **must** always keep your work secure and confidential whilst you are preparing it; **do not** share it with your classmates. If it is stored on the computer network, keep your password secure. Collect all copies from the printer and destroy those you do not need.
- **Do not** be tempted to use pre-prepared online solutions (such as those produced by AI tools and chatbots) – this is cheating. Electronic tools used by WJEC can detect this sort of copying.
- You **must not** write inappropriate, offensive or obscene material.

#### **Plagiarism**

Plagiarism involves taking someone else's words, thoughts or ideas and trying to pass them off as your own. **It is a form of cheating which is taken very seriously.** Don't think you won't be caught; there are many ways to detect plagiarism:

- Markers can spot changes in the style of writing and use of language.
- Markers are highly experienced subject specialists they may have read the source you are using, or even marked the work you have copied from!
- Internet search engines and specialised computer software can be used to match phrases or pieces of text with original sources and to detect changes in the grammar and style of writing or punctuation.

#### **Penalties for breaking the regulations**

If it is discovered that you have broken the regulations, one of the following penalties will be applied:

- the piece of work will be awarded zero marks
- you will be disqualified from that unit for the assessment series in question
- you will be disqualified from the whole subject for that assessment series
- you will be disqualified from all subjects and barred from entering again for a period of time.

WJEC will decide which penalty is appropriate.

**Remember – it's your qualification so it needs to be your own work.**

#### **Authentication Declaration**

I declare that my work was completed independently and without any assistance beyond that which was permitted. All work is my own, except for any non-original material clearly credited above. This work has not been submitted for any other qualification. I have clearly referenced any sources and any Artificial Intelligence tools used in the work. I understand that false declaration is a form of malpractice.

<span id="page-17-0"></span><sup>1</sup> Where you have used AI tools as a source of information, you must show the name of the AI source used and the date the content was generated. For example: ChatGPT 3.5 [\(https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/\)](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/), 25/01/2023. You must, retain a copy of the question(s) and computer-generated content for reference and authentication purposes, in a noneditable format (such as a screenshot) and provide a brief explanation of how it has been used. This must be submitted with your work, so your teacher/assessor is able to review the work, the AI-generated content and how it has been used.
