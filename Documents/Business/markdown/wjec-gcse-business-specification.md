## 1. INTRODUCTION

<span id="page-6-1"></span>

### 1.1 Aims

GCSE Business supports learners to develop:

- an understanding of the activities that make a business successful
- an appreciation of the complex, pluralistic and diverse nature of society by understanding the role and influence of business and innovation on people, places, and community
- an understanding of business processes, incentives, and outcomes, within their cynefin, and how these can influence opportunities for prosperity
- an understanding of the relationship between business and the environment
- an understanding of technology and its impact on business, the environment, and people
- an understanding of the ethical implications of a business.

These aims are set out in Qualifications Wales' Approval Criteria.

<span id="page-6-2"></span>

### 1.2 Curriculum for Wales

This GCSE Business qualification is underpinned by the Curriculum for Wales framework and has been designed to ensure that learners can continue to make progress towards the four purposes whilst studying for this qualification. Central to this design are the [principles of progression,](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/humanities/principles-of-progression/) along with the [statements of](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/humanities/statements-of-what-matters/)  [what matters](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/humanities/statements-of-what-matters/) and those [subject specific skills and concepts](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/humanities/designing-your-curriculum/#specific-considerations-for-this-area) outlined in the '[Designing](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/humanities/designing-your-curriculum/)  [your Curriculum](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/humanities/designing-your-curriculum/)' section of the Humanities Area of Learning and Experiences.

In developing this qualification, we have considered where there are opportunities to embed the cross-curricular themes and where there are opportunities for integral skills and cross-curricular skills to be developed. Appendix A provides a simple mapping, and information to support teachers will be provided in the Guidance for Teaching.

We have also considered where the qualification can generate opportunities for integrating the learning experiences noted in Opportunities for integration of learning experiences on page 38, the Guidance for Teaching will include further information on integrating these learning experiences into delivery.

The GCSE Business qualification supports the Curriculum for Wales by:

- supporting the statements of what matters*0F* [1](#page-6-3) by giving learners the opportunity to:
  - gain a deeper understanding of the concepts underpinning humanities, and their application in local, national and global contexts
  - gather, justify, present, analyse, and evaluate a range of evidence
  - explore how and why interpretations may differ and by critical understanding of a range of interpretations and representations derived from a variety of evidence
  - understand and appreciate how and why places in their locality and elsewhere in Wales, as well as in the wider world, are changing
  - understand, as producers and consumers, their own impact on the natural world

{8}------------------------------------------------

- develop their own identity and an awareness of how they, as individuals, can shape the communities in which they live
- heighten their awareness of how the future sustainability of our world and climate change is influenced by the impact of those actions
- appreciate how the evolution of places, communities and societies is driven by the interplay between a range of factors, including environmental, economic, social, political and cultural processes and human actions
- develop an understanding of their responsibilities as citizens of Wales and the wider interconnected world
- develop as self-aware, informed, ethical global citizens, who critically reflect on their own and others' beliefs, values and attitudes.
- supporting the principles of progression*1F* [2](#page-7-0) by encouraging learners to:
  - ask increasingly sophisticated enquiry questions
  - demonstrate greater independence in finding suitable information, making informed predictions and hypotheses, and making judgements
  - increase their breadth and depth of knowledge and underlying concepts
  - develop an understanding of themselves in the world
  - demonstrate an ability to work with an increasing number and sophistication of sources of information, and a growing understanding of how to resolve contradictory or conflicting accounts
  - demonstrate a growing ability to transfer existing skills and knowledge into new, and increasingly unfamiliar contexts.
- supporting the subject specific considerations for Business*2F* [3](#page-7-1) by:
  - developing an understanding of business and its value to individuals, society and the Welsh national and global economy
  - enabling learners to appreciate that the environment in which business takes place is constantly changing
  - appreciating the impact of business on people's lives and the environment
  - examining ways in which businesses succeed or fail and the strategies required for success
  - developing an understanding of the contribution that business has in shaping the prosperity of communities and thereby people's prospects for the future
  - exploring business creation through enterprise and entrepreneurship
  - developing skills to empower business problem-solving and decision making.

The GCSE Business qualification is based on the following concepts:

- business and society
- business fundamentals
- business strategies for success
- change
- cynefin
- economies
- enquiry and investigation
- enterprise/entrepreneurship
- ethics
- innovation
- opportunities and challenges
- sustainability.

<span id="page-8-0"></span>

### 1.3 Prior learning and progression

Although there is no specific requirement for prior learning, the qualification is designed primarily for learners between the ages of 14 and 16 and builds on the conceptual understanding learners have developed through their learning from ages 3 – 14.

The qualification allows learners to develop a strong foundation of knowledge, skills and understanding which supports progression to post-16 study and prepares learners for life, learning and work. The qualification provides a suitable foundation for the study of Business at either AS or A level. In addition, the specification provides a coherent, satisfying and worthwhile course of study for learners who do not progress to further study in this subject.

<span id="page-8-1"></span>

### 1.4 Guided learning hours

GCSE Business has been designed to be delivered within 120 – 140 guided learning hours. The qualification has been primarily designed as a 2-year programme for learners in years 10 and 11.

<span id="page-8-2"></span>

### 1.5 Use of language

As our understanding of diversity, equity, and inclusion evolves, so must our language. Updated terminology better reflects individual identities and fosters respect and accuracy. Language used should be specific as possible. Staying informed and adaptable is crucial, as inclusive language promotes dignity and equity. Recognising that language will continue to evolve, we will remain open to further amendments to ensure it accurately represents and supports all individuals. WJEC will inform centres of any amendments and the most up to date version of the specification will always be on the website.

<span id="page-8-3"></span>

### 1.6 Equality and fair access

The specification may be followed by any learner, irrespective of gender, ethnic, religious or cultural background. It has been designed to avoid, where possible, features that could, without justification, make it more difficult for a learner to access and achieve because they have a particular protected characteristic.

The protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010 are age, disability, gender reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and sexual orientation.

Access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are made for eligible learners to enable them to access the assessments and demonstrate their knowledge and skills without changing the demands of the assessment.

Information on access arrangements and reasonable adjustments is found in the following document from the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ): Access Arrangements, Reasonable Adjustments: General and Vocational Qualifications. This document is available on the JCQ website [\(www.jcq.org.uk\)](http://www.jcq.org.uk/).

We will be following the principles set out in this document and, as a consequence of provision for reasonable adjustments, very few learners will encounter a complete barrier to any part of the assessment.

## 2 SUBJECT CONTENT

<span id="page-9-1"></span>

#### How to read the amplification

The amplification provided in the right-hand column uses the following four stems:

- 'Learners should be aware of' is used when learners do not need to understand all aspects of the specified content in detail. Teachers should refer to Guidance for Teaching documents for further guidance on the depth and breadth to which this content should be taught.
- 'Learners should know' is used when learners are required to demonstrate basic knowledge and understanding.
- 'Learners should understand' is used when learners are required to demonstrate greater depth of knowledge and understanding, application of knowledge to familiar or unfamiliar contexts and analysis and evaluation of information for a given purpose.
- 'Learners should be able to' is used when learners need to apply their knowledge and understanding to a practical situation or demonstrate application of practical skills and techniques.

The use of the word 'including' indicates that the specified content must be taught and could be subject to assessment.

The use of the words 'for example' or 'such as' indicates that the specified content is for guidance only, and alternative examples could be chosen.

## Opportunities for integration of learning experiences

GCSE Business generates opportunities for the following learning experiences to be developed (experiences will not be directly assessed):

- engage in out of classroom learning (either in person or online) in contrasting business sectors
- explore enterprise and innovation in action for example through engaging with business mentors in person or online
- develop confidence to take risks and overcome creative challenges
- develop empathy, tolerance, compassion, and curiosity through engaging with different and diverse business contexts, and perspectives
- engage in collaborative working
- gain awareness and appreciation of some of the different careers and work-related areas, linked to the subject content

The Guidance for Teaching will include further information on the opportunities provided by the qualification for teachers/centres to integrate these learning experiences into delivery.

For opportunities to develop cross-cutting themes, cross-curricular skills and integral skills please see Appendix A.

## 3.2 Arrangements for non-examination assessment

#### Unit 2

For this assessment learners are required to investigate a business that operates in their locality. The business they investigate can be a local scale business only operating in the locality or a national or global business that has a presence in the locality.

Learners will be required to undertake research on their chosen business and to use their research findings to produce a report. Part A of the report will be compulsory, but for part B, WJEC will select two themes from the specification content (Business ethics, Business and the environment and Business and Technology) and centres and/or learners will choose **one** of the selected themes.

The assignment, featuring the two selected themes and associated tasks, will be released during the first week of September for assessment for that academic year and will change annually. The themes are published in the Assessment Pack for Unit 2 for five years. This will be updated to ensure there are always five years' worth of themes to allow for forward planning. Centres have the flexibility to decide when, during the assessment year, learners undertake the assignment. However, it is important that centres select the topic from the year that they plan to submit the work for marking as this may be different to the year that the candidates undertake the assessment.

This assessment contributes to 15% of the overall qualification grade and will take 5 hours to complete. The assignment could be completed in one sitting, or in multiple, shorter sessions. The assignment will be marked out of a total of 48 marks.

This unit will be assessed through an externally set assignment and will be set and marked by WJEC. Assessments must be submitted digitally (they may be hand written and scanned, or completed digitally).

#### Unit 4

For this assessment learners are required to identify an opportunity for an entrepreneurial activity in their locality. This opportunity must meet the needs of people and society.

Learners will be required to carry out primary and secondary market research to collect information for their entrepreneurial opportunity, and to use the research to produce a report that covers key aspects of their proposal.

The assignment, which will include a brief and several tasks will be issued to centres in an Assessment pack via the WJEC Portal. Tasks are not intended to change for the lifetime of the qualification. If candidates choose to resit this unit at a later date, they must choose another entrepreneurial opportunity to explore. Centres have the flexibility to decide when, during the assessment year, learners undertake the assignment.

This assessment contributes to 25% of the overall qualification grade and will take 8 hours to complete. The assignment could be completed in one sitting, or in multiple, shorter sessions. The assignment will be marked out of a total of 60 marks.

{42}------------------------------------------------

This unit will be assessed through an externally set assignment and will be marked by the centre and moderated by WJEC. Assessments must be submitted digitally (they may be hand written and scanned, or completed digitally).

{43}------------------------------------------------

<span id="page-42-0"></span>

## 4 MALPRACTICE

Before the course starts, the teacher is responsible for informing candidates of WJEC's regulations concerning malpractice. Candidates must not take part in any unfair practice in the preparation of work for GCSE Business.

Information regarding malpractice is available in our [Guide to preventing, reporting and](https://www.wjec.co.uk/media/0pjats1l/guide-to-preventing-reporting-and-investigating-malpractice-april-2022-002.pdf)  [investigating malpractice.](https://www.wjec.co.uk/media/0pjats1l/guide-to-preventing-reporting-and-investigating-malpractice-april-2022-002.pdf)

All cases of suspected or actual malpractice must be reported immediately to WJEC [\(malpractice@wjec.co.uk\)](mailto:malpractice@wjec.co.uk). If candidates commit malpractice, they may be penalised or disqualified from the examinations.

In all cases of malpractice, centres are advised to consult the JCQ booklet [Suspected](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice)  [Malpractice: Policies and Procedures.](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice)

## 5 TECHNICAL INFORMATION

<span id="page-43-1"></span>

#### 5.1 Entries and awards

This is a unitised qualification. Candidates are entered for each unit separately.

Assessment opportunities will be available in the summer assessment period each year, for the lifetime of the specification.

Unit 1, Unit 2 and Unit 3 will be available in 2026 (and each year thereafter). Unit 4 will be available in 2027 (and each year thereafter) and the qualification will be awarded for the first time in summer 2027.

Pre-16 Candidates (i.e. candidates who are 16 or under on 31st August in the academic year in which they were entered)

The terminal rule is set at 40% of the overall qualification for Pre-16 Candidates for GCSE Business.

If the assessment being re-taken contributes to the 40% terminal rule requirement, the mark for the new assessment will count regardless of previous results in that assessment.

Candidates may resit an individual unit once only. The better uniform mark score from the two attempts will be used in calculating the final overall grade subject to the terminal rule being satisfied first, i.e. that candidates must complete 40% of the assessment for a qualification in the series in which they are cashing in.

If any unit has been attempted twice and a candidate wishes to enter the unit for the third time, the candidate will have to re-enter all units and the appropriate cash-in(s). This is referred to as a 'fresh start'. When retaking a qualification (fresh start), a candidate may have up to two attempts at each unit. However, no results from examination units taken prior to the fresh start can be used in aggregating the new grade(s).

If a candidate has been entered for but is absent for a unit, the absence does not count as an attempt. The candidate would, however, qualify as a resit candidate in the final resit series.

Marks for non-examination assessment may be used for the life of the specification.

Post-16 Candidates (i.e. candidates who are 16 or over on 1st September in the academic year in which they are entered)

There is no terminal rule that applies to Post-16 Candidates for GCSE Business.

There is no limit on the number of times a candidate can resit an individual unit; however, the better uniform mark score from the most two recent attempts will be used in calculating the final overall grade.

The 'fresh start' rule does not apply to post-16 candidates.

If a candidate has been entered for but is absent for a unit, the absence does not count as an attempt. The candidate would, however, qualify as a resit candidate in the final resit series.
