1,2,have decided,Qualifications Wales **have decided** that these qualifications will be introduced in a phased way; WJEC is now developing the qualifications that are to be available for first teaching from September 2025 to meet these requirements.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"'Qualifications Wales' is a singular entity (an organisation), and therefore requires the singular verb 'has decided' for subject-verb agreement."
2,3,nonexamination,"This was particularly prevalent in qualifications where the **nonexamination** assessment is either new or significantly increased.

It must be noted that WJEC cannot change the amount of non-examination assessment or the proportion to be marked by schools, in the new made-for-Wales GCSEs and related qualifications.",ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,98,The term 'non-examination' should be hyphenated as per standard British English usage for compound adjectives.
3,3,wellbeing,"A notable area of concern in consultation responses and discussions with stakeholder groups links to learners undertaking non-examination assessment across a number of subjects, and the potential negative impact this could have on learner **wellbeing**.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,85,"The term 'wellbeing' is used unhyphenated here, but 'well-being' is used on page 4 in reference to Welsh Government guidance. For consistency, 'well-being' (hyphenated) should be used throughout."
4,4,nonexamination,"Some stakeholders felt that **nonexamination** assessment can further disadvantage some learners, for example, those who do not have support or access to adequate resources at home.",ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,98,The term 'non-examination' should be hyphenated as per standard British English usage for compound adjectives.
5,4,maximalise,"However, one stakeholder group had a different view on what impacted equity, requesting that the GCSEs have a range of assessment methods, focusing on competency-based continuous assessment methods, rather than coursework or mini-tests, to **maximalise** equity.",ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,95,"The correct British English term is 'maximise', not 'maximalise'."
6,4,Qualification Wales,"When we submit our qualifications to **Qualification Wales** for approval, we must stipulate how we have managed the balance of manageability, engagement, reliability and validity.",ErrorCategory.FACTUAL_INACCURACY,99,"The official name of the body is 'Qualifications Wales' (plural), as used consistently elsewhere in the document."
7,5,nonexamination,"Where this is the case, scanning and uploading of **nonexamination** assessment could be time-consuming, particularly when considering the scale of non-examination assessment across the suite of qualifications.",ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,98,The term 'non-examination' should be hyphenated as per standard British English usage for compound adjectives.
8,7,time spent on or volume of work to be submitted,"A couple of respondents proposed setting limits on the **time spent on or volume of work to be submitted** for the portfolio; however, after consulting further with stakeholders via our Development Advisory Group, we have decided not to proceed with this but to retain the current flexibility.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The phrasing is slightly awkward and could be clearer by explicitly linking 'time spent on' and 'volume of work' to the portfolio for improved flow.
9,8,work(s),Respondents noted concerns about the unprepared **work(s)** in the external examination.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,75,"In formal writing, it is generally clearer to choose either the singular or plural form, or to rephrase, rather than using the parenthetical '(s)'."
10,8,states,The Approval Criteria **states** that 30% of the qualification must be assessed by external examination which must include questions on unprepared works.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,"'Criteria' is a plural noun, so the verb should be 'state' to agree with the plural subject."
11,8,anytime,stipulating that both the performing and composing units could be assessed **anytime** during the course,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,"While 'anytime' is acceptable as an adverb, 'any time' (two words) is generally preferred in formal British English for clarity and traditional usage."
12,9,that the proposed assessment approach is appropriate,"Respondents generally agreed or partially agreed **that the proposed assessment approach is appropriate**, that the unit purposes are appropriate and engaging for learners and meet the qualification purpose and aims, and that the assessment approach is appropriate.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,90,"The phrase 'that the proposed assessment approach is appropriate' is repeated unnecessarily, making the sentence clunky and less concise."
13,10,around,Some concerns were raised **around** the number of non-examination assessments.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,'About' is generally preferred over 'around' when referring to a topic or subject in formal British English.
14,10,this non-examination assessment is 15% of the qualification and is therefore smaller than the fieldwork non-examination assessment at 25%.,"As the Approval Criteria state that one of the non-examination assessments must be marked by the centre and moderated by the WJEC, the Decision Making Exercise will now be marked by centres and moderated by WJEC; **this non-examination assessment is 15% of the qualification and is therefore smaller than the fieldwork non-examination assessment at 25%**.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,"The sentence is overly long and repetitive, particularly with the repeated use of 'non-examination assessment', which hinders readability and conciseness."
15,10,to widen out,"Consequently, we have removed the reference to exploring fieldwork in learners' locality, **to widen out** the area that learners can explore.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,'To widen' or 'to broaden' would be more concise and formal than 'to widen out' in this context.
16,10,submission we,Following feedback on digital **submission we** will be exploring this further at the next stage of development.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,A comma is needed after the introductory participial phrase 'Following feedback on digital submission' to separate it from the main clause.
17,11,whilst,"Some respondents expressed that there was excessive emphasis on Welsh history (Unit 1 – An in-depth study on Welsh history and Unit 4 – Wales and Britain/the UK) **whilst** others welcomed the focus, noting that they felt it aligned with the Curriculum for Wales.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,70,"'While' is generally preferred over 'whilst' in modern formal British English for conciseness, though 'whilst' is not grammatically incorrect."
18,11,during,Some respondents expressed concern about the potential amount of content to be covered **during** the number of teaching hours available.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,75,"'Given' or 'for' would be more precise than 'during' in this context, as it refers to the constraint of available hours rather than an action occurring within a time period."
19,12,was manageable,Respondents generally agreed or partially agreed that the proposed qualification structure and assessment approach is appropriate and that the proposed qualification **was manageable** for learners.,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,The present tense 'is appropriate' should be maintained for 'manageable' as the qualification is currently being proposed and evaluated.
20,12,on non-religious,This was not the intention – the qualification will place equal value on religious and **on non-religious** beliefs and philosophical convictions.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The second 'on' is redundant; 'on religious and non-religious beliefs' is more concise and grammatically sound.
21,12,states,"The Approval Criteria from Qualifications Wales **states** that learners must develop knowledge and understanding of Christianity (or Catholic Christianity) and at least one other religion to be chosen from the following list: Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism and Sikhism (Sikhi).",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,"'Criteria' is a plural noun, so the verb should be 'state' to agree with the plural subject."
22,13,i.e.,"• Relating to the specific units, some respondents felt there were repeated topics **i.e.** human rights, with some respondents questioning why a religious studies qualification was teaching human rights.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,90,"'i.e.' (id est, 'that is') is used for clarification or rephrasing, while 'e.g.' (exempli gratia, 'for example') is used for examples. 'Human rights' is an example, not a rephrasing. A comma should also follow 'i.e.' if used."
23,13,nonreligious,"Unit 3 – Human experience and the world focuses on how environmental issues are approached by people with different religious and/or **nonreligious** beliefs, whereas, Unit 4 – Human rights focuses on ethical/moral, human rights issues from religious and non-religious perspectives.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,95,"The term 'non-religious' is hyphenated elsewhere in the document (e.g., page 12), so it should be consistent here."
24,13,states,"Human rights have historically been an area of study within religious studies, and the Approval Criteria from Qualifications Wales **states** that human rights must be explored through the unique subject lens of religious studies.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,"'Criteria' is a plural noun, so the verb should be 'state' to agree with the plural subject."
25,14,from reading,"It will validly secure the requirements of the Approval Criteria that learners must develop their skills **from reading** a variety of text and media, understand and interpret their meaning and message and allow them to further explore ""Cymraeg and me"", whilst building on the skills and knowledge developed as part of the Core Cymraeg qualification.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,"'By reading' is a more appropriate preposition to indicate the means by which skills are developed, rather than 'from reading' which implies a source."
26,14,allow them,"It will validly secure the requirements of the Approval Criteria that learners must develop their skills from reading a variety of text and media, understand and interpret their meaning and message and **allow them** to further explore ""Cymraeg and me"", whilst building on the skills and knowledge developed as part of the Core Cymraeg qualification.",ErrorCategory.AMBIGUOUS_PHRASING,90,"The phrasing 'allow them' is ambiguous; it is unclear whether 'them' refers to the learners allowing themselves, or if the requirements are intended to allow/enable the learners. Rephrasing to 'enable learners to further explore' or 'allow learners to further explore' would clarify."
27,15,note,"However, Qualifications Wales' Approval Criteria **note** that both the Single and Double awards must include both narrative fictional prose and visual literature, a range of poems and a range of non-fiction texts.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The noun 'Criteria' is plural, so the verb should be 'state' to agree with the plural subject. The document later uses 'state' for 'Approval Criteria', indicating a plural interpretation."
28,15,represent,Our specification writer for this unit is aware of the concerns and we will aim to include writing that **represent** a variety of perspectives reflecting the diverse nature of Welsh citizenship and its cultures in order to make the unit interesting and relevant to learners.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The subject of the verb 'represent' is 'writing' (singular), so the verb should be 'represents' to agree with the singular subject."
29,15,states,We are unable to address these points as they reflect decisions made by Qualifications Wales; the Approval Criteria **states** that 50% of the qualification will be assessed through nonexamination assessment and marked by the centre.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The noun 'Criteria' is plural, so the verb should be 'state' to agree with the plural subject. The document later uses 'state' for 'Approval Criteria', indicating a plural interpretation."
30,15,nonexamination,"To help support concerns about teacher and learner workload, we have spread the **nonexamination** assessments across the Autumn and Spring terms to aid manageability.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"The term 'non-examination assessment' is hyphenated elsewhere in the document (e.g., page 17), so it should be hyphenated here for consistency."
31,16,set text,"In response, we are exploring opportunities to add **set text** to Unit 2 and Unit 4.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,90,"Given that the text refers to 'Unit 2 and Unit 4', it implies multiple texts, so 'set texts' (plural) would be grammatically correct."
32,17,nonexamination,Learners will be allowed and encouraged to supplement the anthology texts with their own selections when preparing for the **nonexamination** assessment tasks in Units 3 and 5.,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"The term 'non-examination assessment' is hyphenated elsewhere on the same page (e.g., 'non-examination assessment in Units 3 and 5'), so it should be hyphenated here for consistency."
33,17,were,"The length of the examinations for Units 1, 4 and 6 **were** considered by some respondents to be too long.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The subject of the verb is 'length' (singular), so the verb should be 'was' to agree with the singular subject."
34,18,being from,"WJEC received 90 responses, with over half of those **being from** practitioners within a school.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The phrase 'being from' is often verbose and can be simplified to 'from' without loss of meaning in formal writing.
35,18,Taking into regard,"**Taking into regard** all comments from the consultation, there was concern that five units may put learners off from opting for a language and that it would appear to be more challenging than other subjects.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,'Taking into regard' is not a standard English idiom; 'taking into consideration' or 'with regard to' would be correct.
36,18,awarding body and marked by the awarding body,the Approval Criteria state that a total of between 45–50% of the qualification must be assessed through non-examination assessment tasks that are set by the **awarding body and marked by the awarding body**.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,Repetition of 'awarding body' can be avoided for conciseness and improved flow; consider rephrasing to 'by the awarding body and marked by them' or similar.
37,18,take up,Some responses in the consultation referred to non-tiering impacting learner confidence and **take up**.,ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,90,"As a noun meaning 'adoption' or 'acceptance', 'take-up' should be hyphenated in British English."
38,18,around,Some concerns were raised **around** the number of non-examination assessments.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,75,'About' is generally preferred over 'around' when referring to a topic or subject in formal writing.
39,18,over the timing,There was some concern **over the timing** of Unit 1 non-examination assessment in terms of clashes with Welsh oral assessments during the established 5-week oral assessment window.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,75,'Regarding' or 'about' is generally preferred over 'over' when referring to a topic or subject in formal writing.
40,18,over the duration,Some concerns were also raised **over the duration** of the Unit 3 listening exam (set at 45 minutes) which was deemed to be too long.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,75,'Regarding' or 'about' is generally preferred over 'over' when referring to a topic or subject in formal writing.
41,18,35 mins,"However, the current Foundation Tier listening is set at **35 mins** with 5 mins additional reading time, and Higher Tier 45 with 5 mins additional reading time.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,The abbreviation 'mins' is inconsistent with the full word 'minutes' used earlier in the same paragraph; maintain consistency in formal documents.
42,18,Higher Tier 45,"However, the current Foundation Tier listening is set at 35 mins with 5 mins additional reading time, and **Higher Tier 45** with 5 mins additional reading time.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"This phrase is a sentence fragment and lacks a verb, making it grammatically incomplete in this context; it should be 'Higher Tier is set at 45 minutes'."
43,19,along with,WJEC will set parameters for text selection **along with** exemplars in each language.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,70,'Along with' can sometimes be less formal; 'and provide' or similar phrasing would be more direct and professional.
44,19,have,"However, Qualifications Wales **have** since removed this requirement from the Approval Criteria and the qualification outline has therefore been revised to include translation from the assessed language into English only.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"'Qualifications Wales' is a singular entity, and therefore requires the singular verb 'has' for subject-verb agreement."

46,19,whether,Respondents asked for clarification **whether** Unit 1: Financial Mathematics and Other Applications of Numeracy would permit the use of a calculator.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,90,The phrase 'asked for clarification whether' is grammatically incomplete; it should be 'asked for clarification on whether' or simply 'asked whether'.
47,19,calculator permitted assessment,"We can confirm that this is the case, resulting in the GCSE having an overall split of 70% **calculator permitted assessment**, and 30% non-calculator assessment.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,'Calculator-permitted' functions as a compound adjective modifying 'assessment' and should be hyphenated for clarity in British English.
48,20,foundation tier,Some respondents expressed concern that the proposed duration of 1 hour 45 minutes for the examination of Unit 3 is too long at **foundation tier**.,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"'Foundation Tier' is capitalised elsewhere in the document (Page 18), indicating it is a proper noun or specific term and should be consistent."
49,20,answering on behalf of a school,"WJEC received 55 responses, with 45% of respondents **answering on behalf of a school**.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,70,Adding 'who' before 'answering' would clarify the subject of the participle phrase and improve sentence flow.
50,20,were,The majority of respondents agreed that the focus of the units **were** appropriate and that they were relevant and engaging for learners.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The subject 'focus' is singular, so the verb should be 'was' for subject-verb agreement."
51,20,are,"Respondents generally agreed or partially agreed that the qualification structure and approach to assessment **are** appropriate, that the proposed qualification will support the Curriculum for Wales and that the proposed qualification was manageable for centres and learners alike.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The subject 'approach' (part of 'qualification structure and approach') is singular, so the verb should be 'is' for subject-verb agreement."

55,21,sub-reporting of grades,"It should be noted that the results of examinations for Unit 3 – Biology, Unit 4 – Chemistry, and Unit 5 – Physics will include **sub-reporting of grades** for the individual science subjects. This means learners will receive an overall grade for the qualification, and sub-grades for biology, chemistry, and physics.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,"The phrase 'sub-reporting of grades' is less concise than 'sub-grades,' which is used immediately after in the same sentence."
