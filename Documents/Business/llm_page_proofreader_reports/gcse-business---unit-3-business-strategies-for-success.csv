6,16,band marked,For **band marked** questions mark schemes are in two parts; the indicative content and the assessment grid.,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,The term 'banded mark questions' is used on page 17 and aligns with the heading 'Banded mark schemes'; 'band marked' here is inconsistent.
7,16,in two parts; the indicative content,For band marked questions mark schemes are **in two parts; the indicative content** and the assessment grid.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"A colon should be used to introduce a list or explanation that follows an independent clause, not a semicolon."
8,17,matches,"If the descriptors at the lowest band are satisfied, examiners should move up to the next band and repeat this process for each band until the descriptors most closely **matches** the work.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,100,"The plural subject 'descriptors' requires the plural verb 'match', not 'matches'."
9,17,that,"Marking should be positive, rewarding achievement rather **that** penalising failure or omissions.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,100,"The correct idiom is 'rather than', not 'rather that'."
10,17,Standardising material,**Standardising material** that has already been awarded a mark will be provided during standardising and this should be used as a reference material when assessing work.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,"For a formal noun phrase, 'Standardisation material' or 'Standardised material' is generally preferred over 'Standardising material'."
11,17,standardising,Standardising material that has already been awarded a mark will be provided during **standardising** and this should be used as a reference material when assessing work.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,"In this context, 'standardisation' (the noun) is more appropriate than 'standardising' (the gerund/present participle)."

A full stop should separate 'response' and 'Award'."
14,24,filling in as,"For example, if its sandwiches do not have as much **filling in as** previous visits they may switch to a competitor.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The phrasing 'filling in as' is awkward; 'as much filling as in previous visits' or 'as much filling as previous visits' would be more natural.
15,24,what loaf,"Since customers are likely to regularly purchase from their local Jenkins Bakery store, they are likely to have a more personal level of service from the staff, such as remembering **what loaf** of bread they usually purchase.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,75,"'Which' is generally preferred when referring to a choice from a defined set of options, making 'which loaf' more precise in this context."
16,24,"Google, for","Customers may leave good reviews on TripAdvisor or **Google, for** the business, which will encourage new customers to try its products, increasing sales.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The comma after 'Google' is superfluous and disrupts the flow of the prepositional phrase 'for the business'.
17,24,high quality product,"Customers will trust Jenkins Bakery to always produce a **high quality product**. This means that they will become regular customers and are more likely to purchase other items from its product range, such as buying a cake alongside their regular loaf of bread.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The compound adjective 'high-quality' should be hyphenated when it precedes the noun it modifies.

19,26,its employees,(d) Identify one financial method of motivation used by businesses to motivate **its employees**.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The singular possessive pronoun 'its' does not agree with the plural noun 'businesses'; it should be 'their employees'.
20,26,applying job training,Award one mark for **applying job training** for new employees in Jenkins Bakery.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,70,The phrasing 'applying job training' is awkward; 'applying on-the-job training' or 'applying the concept of job training' would be more natural.

24,29,is mean by,"With reference to EdenHarvest, explain what **is mean by** unique selling point (USP).",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,100,The verb tense is incorrect; it should be 'what is meant by' for passive voice.
25,30,suitable to,"Price Skimming, psychological and cost-plus could all be justified to be **suitable to** EdenHarvest.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,"While 'suitable to' is not strictly incorrect, 'suitable for' is generally preferred in formal British English when referring to appropriateness for an entity."
26,30,EdenHarvest sell,This is important as the more eco-friendly products **EdenHarvest sell** are more expensive than the non-eco-friendly products offered by its competitors.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,Subject-verb agreement requires 'sells' because 'EdenHarvest' is a singular business entity.
27,30,organic they may confuse,"Remove packaged products, even though these are **organic they may confuse** the customer as they are not zero-waste.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"This is a comma splice, joining two independent clauses ('even though these are organic' and 'they may confuse the customer') with only a comma."
28,30,Packaging cannot be awarded,**Packaging cannot be awarded** as the business is a zero waste store and it does not fit with its USP.,ErrorCategory.AMBIGUOUS_PHRASING,85,The verb 'awarded' is unclear in this context; it is not typically used to describe the applicability or suitability of packaging for a business.
29,30,lots of people,This may not be suited to EdenHarvest at the current time as there are still **lots of people** who are unaware of its business and so products may go to waste if there are insufficient customers.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,75,'Lots of' is informal; 'many' or 'a lot of' would be more appropriate for a formal document.

32,30,and cause litter,"People may discard a leaflet as it is seen as junk mail, **and cause litter**.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,70,"The phrasing is slightly awkward; rephrasing (e.g., 'and may cause litter' or 'which could cause litter') would improve flow."

34,31,in order to transport them,...add packaging to its products **in order to transport them** which would go against its USP.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,70,'To transport them' is more concise and equally clear.
