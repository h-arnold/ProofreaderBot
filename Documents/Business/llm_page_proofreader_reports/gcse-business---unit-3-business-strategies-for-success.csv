94,30,to be able to choose,The business has gained loyal customers who like the flexibility **to be able to choose** the quantity or weight of each product they buy.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,75,The phrase 'to be able to choose' is less concise than 'to choose' and can be simplified without loss of meaning.

96,30,example you,"A USP sets the product or service apart from the competition, for **example you** can refill your own containers in Eden Harvest.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,70,A comma is typically used after 'for example' when it introduces an illustrative phrase or clause for better readability and flow.

101,31,Packaging cannot be awarded,**Packaging cannot be awarded** as the business is a zero waste store and it does not fit with its USP.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The phrasing 'Packaging cannot be awarded' is awkward and unclear; it likely means that points related to packaging should not be given credit.
