2,6,and information to support teachers will be provided,Appendix A provides a simple mapping **and information to support teachers will be provided** in the Guidance for Teaching.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The conjunction 'and' incorrectly attempts to link a direct object ('a simple mapping') with a new independent clause ('information to support teachers will be provided') without proper punctuation or a more suitable conjunction/restructuring, leading to a grammatically awkward and unclear sentence."
3,7,A level,The qualification is not designed for progression to AS or **A level** Science qualifications.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,90,"In British English, 'A-level' is typically hyphenated when used as a compound adjective before a noun."
4,8,specific as possible,Language used should be **specific as possible**.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The phrase requires 'as' before 'specific' to form the correct comparative structure 'as specific as possible'.
5,9,", it refers","Investigation is one part of scientific enquiry**, it refers** to the systematic process of collecting data to answer a particular scientific question.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"This sentence contains a comma splice, incorrectly joining two independent clauses without a coordinating conjunction or appropriate punctuation."

- the main features of our Solar System in terms of the
  order, relative size and composition of the Sun, the
  planets, the dwarf planets, comets, moons, the
  asteroid belt, the Oort cloud and the Kuiper belt.

If **sub bullets** are used, this indicates that the content given must be further developed. For example:",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"The term 'sub-bullet' is hyphenated earlier in the same paragraph, so 'sub bullets' should be hyphenated for consistency."
7,13,effect,Learners should be able to:<br>• investigate how different factors **effect** enzyme activity.,ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,95,The word 'effect' is used incorrectly as a verb; 'affect' should be used instead to mean 'to influence'.
8,14,speedtime,- calculate acceleration using the gradient of a **speedtime** graph,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,85,The term 'speedtime' should be hyphenated as 'speed-time' for consistency with 'distance-time graphs' used elsewhere in the document and the pre-existing issue.
9,14,aware,### Learners should be **aware**:<br>• that sport scientists can analyse the motion of athletes to measure performance.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The phrase 'aware' requires the preposition 'of' when followed by a clause, forming 'aware of'."
