# Overview of Unit 3

## Our dynamic and diverse world

Written examination: 30% of qualification 90 marks

The purpose of this unit is to introduce learners to key areas of human and physical geography, exploring the economic, social, cultural and political inter-connectedness between people and places. Learners will investigate:

- inequality, focusing on human rights and diversity
- weather
- climate and climate change
- physical and human global challenges, including a focus on endangered environments (land and ocean).

Learners should also develop their mathematical and statistical skills whilst preparing for this Unit. The depth of coverage required of these skills is given in Appendix B on pages 44-45 of the specification.

| In this unit, learners will develop knowledge, skills and understanding in: |                                                 |  |

### Learners should understand:

- the physical and human causes of inequalities in Wales and the UK, including:
  - access to housing and services
  - demographic characteristics
  - industrialisation
  - location, landscape and resources
  - transport and communications.
- how the above causes of inequality are often inter-linked, and that they can be seen in positive and negative lights
- the consequences of inequality in the UK, including:
  - differing perceptions of inequality amongst different groups of people
  - regional variations in wealth, employment, school performance and access to housing and services
  - segregation and its associated benefits and problems, including ethnic enclaves.
- the impacts of inequality on different groups, including Black, Asian and minority ethnic individuals
- how governments in Wales and the UK attempt to reduce regional inequalities, such as:
  - infrastructure projects
  - improving housing and services
  - creating employment
  - education & public awareness
  - race relations initiatives.

Learners will need to understand the causes of inequalities and that these causes are interlinked and contextual. Schools should choose to focus on their local area and could choose to use a completely different place for breadth of learning and a Wales and/or UK comparison. This allows local and individual expertise of teachers to be drawn upon. Examples of interlinking causes of inequalities:

- In the South Wales Valleys rapid industrialisation and urbanisation during the Industrial Revolution, because of natural resources (coal and iron ore), led to the settlement and demographic characteristics we still see today. However, since the decline of heavy industry, economic decline has caused there to be higher unemployment, less investment and fewer services.
- In Eryri National Park, the landscape and its resources have created inequalities in terms of access and present day employment opportunities in the area (typically tourism and hill farming) which can force young people to leave the area in search of work, but also encourage people into the area to purchase holiday homes or for retirement which can push house prices up and force more people to move away. It should also be noted that this area saw significant historical industrialisation – slate mines for example due its natural resources. The closure of these industries also led to out migration. This can cause a spiral of decline in terms of service provision. Alternatively, the landscape has provided opportunities for adventure sport and tourism industries.
- It is important for learners to recognise that individuals/groups will have different lived experiences of these inequalities and that they can be viewed positively and negatively.

Learners can consider the consequences of inequalities in the UK, including segregation between different communities e.g. Somalis in Cardiff. The impacts of inequalities in terms of access to services e.g. education, health care and jobs.

{10}------------------------------------------------

### Actions to reduce inequalities :

- infrastructure projects – HS2 , Northern Powerhouse
- improving housing and services – affordable & social homes , taxes on second/holiday homes in Wales, subsidising high speed internet connectivity, Project Gigabit
- creating employment – freeports are expected to bring 20 ,000 new high skilled jobs and £5 billion of private and public investment, apprenticeship programmes, Young Persons Guarantee, circular econom y
- education – targeted funding e.g. Pupil Development Grant (PDG), recruitment and retention of high -quality teachers in more deprived areas
- public awareness and race relations initiatives – race equality action plan , Race Council Cymru (RCC), Equality Act 2010 .

# Suggested teacher and learning activities:

- this topic area would lend itself to a mystery classroom activity or a carousel
- learners could investigate their home area in terms of inequalities
- learners could use choropleth maps and other graphical techniques to both present and interpret data.

It highlights<br>the differences in wealth, resources, infrastructure, healthcare,<br>education and living standards. The development gap is often<br>characterised by the divide between most developed countries (HICs)<br>and least developed countries (LICs). HICs typically have a higher<br>GDP per capita, better access to services, advanced technology and<br>higher levels of education and health care, whereas LICs may<br>struggle with poverty, limited access to basic services and lower life<br>expectancy.<br>Understanding the factors that contribute to the development gap is<br>crucial to addressing global inequalities, and to promote sustainable<br>development to raise the quality of life for people in less developed<br>regions.<br>Learners should be taught about the history of the development gap,<br>via colonialism and through post-colonial ties. Learners should<br>understand that colonisers still benefit from their former colonies which<br>impacts their state of development.<br><b>Suggested teaching and learning activities:</b><br>Learners should be able to consider the reasons for differences in<br>social and economic development of a country because of a range<br>of interconnected factors. A country fact file may consider a range<br>of factors. For example, Haiti is the least developed country in the<br>western hemisphere due to:colonialism – independence from France came at a huge<br>economic cost, including subsequent political corruption |

- geographical location at risk from hurricanes/tropical storms/earthquakes - poor before 2010 earthquake, still not recovered
- globalisation few Multi-National Companies (MNCs) will operate in Haiti due to the political unrest and debt owed to France.
- Learners could compare Haiti to France for example and explore why the development levels are so different.

# 3.1.4 Reducing the development gap

### Learners should understand:

- how governments and other agencies are aiming to close the development gap including:
  - aid
  - fair trade
  - Multi-National Companies (MNCs)
  - tourism
- the success and sustainability of strategies to close the development gap.

Learners could study either a single country or a variety of countries to ensure they understand the strategies used to try to close the development gap. Learners could explore the UN sustainable development goals (SDGs) and the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015. These are addressed in Unit 4 but may be studied at the very beginning of the course, to set a context for sustainability in the other units. Governments and agencies work to close the development gap through a combination of aid, fairtrade initiatives, engagement with MNCs and promoting tourism. Each approach has its benefits and challenges, and successful strategies often involve a combination of these elements to create sustainable development that empowers local communities while respecting their rights and environments. In GCSE Geography learners can explore these themes to understand the complexities and interconnections in global development.

### Types of Aid:

- Bilateral Aid Direct assistance from one country to another. For example, the UK provides bilateral aid to countries such as Tanzania and Uganda through the Department for International Development (DFID), focusing on education and health initiatives.
- Multilateral Aid Assistance given by international organizations (such as the UN, World Bank) to help developing countries. For instance, the World Bank funds projects in countries like Ethiopia to enhance agricultural productivity and increase access to markets.
- Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) that work in countries to develop specific areas like health and education over a longer timescale. For examples, Hiwot Ethiopia [\(https://hiwotet.org/\)](https://hiwotet.org/) who aim to improve the health and lives of young people in Ethiopia, or TAHEA [\(https://tahea.or.tz/\)](https://tahea.or.tz/) which is focused on improving the livelihoods of women, children, and marginalised communities in Tanzania through education, community development, and sustainable agricultural practices.

{15}------------------------------------------------

### Benefits of giving aid:

- provision of financial resources for infrastructure projects (e.g. roads, schools, hospitals)
- support for health care and education to improve literacy rates and overall quality of life
- emergency aid during natural disasters or crises.

### Challenges of giving aid:

- dependency on aid can diminish self-sufficiency
- corruption can hinder effective distribution and use of funds.

### Fairtrade:

Products like Fairtrade coffee from Colombia and cocoa from Ghana showcase how Fairtrade can help small-scale farmers gain fair wages, improve their living conditions and invest in community projects.

Example: Divine Chocolate - a company that is a Fairtrade producer of chocolate, where farmers from Ghana receive a fair price for cocoa and a premium that can be reinvested in their communities, allowing for improvements in education and health services.

### Benefits of Fairtrade include:

- ensures that producers in developing countries receive fair wages and working conditions
- encourages sustainable farming practices and protects the environment
- increases income for farmers and helps lift communities out of poverty
- develops local economies by reducing reliance on exploitative practices of larger corporations
- educates consumers about ethical purchasing and the impact of their choices.

{16}------------------------------------------------

Multinational Corporations (MNCs):

Example: Unilever has numerous initiatives in developing countries where it sources products, such as its Sustainable Living Plan, which aims to improve health, hygiene, and agricultural practices in countries like India and Kenya, while providing jobs and promoting local procurement.

Example: Coca-Cola's 5by20 initiative aims to empower five million women entrepreneurs across their global value chain by 2020. This initiative has a significant impact in countries like Nigeria and South Africa, providing resources and training to women-owned businesses.

Example: Huawei has invested in ICT infrastructure in Tanzania, developed jobs and skills including smart education programs, and is training university students in Tanzania in the latest ICT in its Seeds for the Future program.

Example: African MNC – Dangote Group is involved in infrastructure projects, building schools, providing scholarships etc. across African nations.

### Benefits of MNCs:

- investments in developing countries can generate jobs and boost local economies
- implementation of corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives that contribute to community development
- technology transfer and skills development through training programs for local workers
- increase in tax revenue for governments, which can be used for public services.

{17}------------------------------------------------

### Challenges of MNCs

- exploitation of resources and labour, which can lead to environmental degradatio n
- profits often repatriated to home countries rather than reinvested locally.

### Tourism :

Example: The Maldives government promotes sustainable tourism, where eco -friendly resorts help to conserve marine biodiversity while providing income and job opportunities for local communities. Revenues generated from tourism are reinvested into local development.

Example: Ghana's Eco -Tourism initiatives involve local communities in the management of national parks and wildlife reserves. This approach not only generates revenue but also empowers communities and promotes conservation. An example is the Kakum National Park, where local guides offer tours.

### Benefits of development through tourism:

- promoting cultural and eco -tourism can provide communities with a sustainable source of income
- investment in infrastructure (e.g., roads, airports) to support tourism can also benefit local populations
- job creation in hospitality, transportation, and related sectors
- Development of local crafts and businesses catering to tourists, promoting cultural exchange.

### Challenges of development through tourism :

- risk of cultural erosion and environmental damage.
- dependence on tourism, which can be volatile due to global events (e.g. pandemics, natural disasters).

{18}------------------------------------------------

### Suggested teaching and learning activities

- debate the success of strategies to close the development gap
- discuss the extent to which strategies are sustainable
- create case study infographics.

# 3.2.2 Factors affecting temperature

Learners should understand the factors that affect temperature patterns of Wales, including:

- air masses
- altitude
- aspect
- latitude
- ocean currents
- prevailing winds.

There are five air masses that affect Wales – polar maritime, tropical maritime, arctic maritime, tropical continental and polar continental, each bringing distinct atmospheric conditions.

Altitude has an impact on temperature - every 100m gained reduces temperature by 1°C.

Aspect is the direction faced and affects the temperature particularly in winter when north facing slopes remain in shadow for most of the day.

Latitude is the distance from the Equator. The latitude in the south of Wales is 51°N and 53°N in Anglesey. Places closer to the Equator are warmer but there's little difference between north and south of Wales.

Ocean currents like the North Atlantic Drift have an impact on the west coast of Wales which is kept milder in winter and cooler in summer. The prevailing wind direction is from the south west, this brings warm wet weather (link to air masses).

Learners need to be able to appreciate that these factors do not exist in isolation and are interlinked to impact temperatures across Wales.

{21}------------------------------------------------

# 3.2.3 Factors affecting rainfall

Learners should understand the three types of rainfall formation:

- convectional
- frontal
- relief.

In Wales, the three main types of rainfall - **convectional**, **frontal**, and **relief** (or orographic) - occur due to the region's geography and climate.

Convectional Rainfall in Wales:

**Occurs**: During warmer months, especially in summer.

**Process**: On hot days, the land heats up, causing warm air to rise. As the air ascends, it cools and condenses, forming clouds and often resulting in brief, intense rain showers.

**Characteristics**: Less common compared to other types, but it can occur in inland areas during summer, occasionally producing thunderstorms and heavy rain.

Frontal Rainfall in Wales:

**Occurs**: Throughout the year, especially during autumn and winter. **Process**: Caused by the meeting of warm, moist air from the Atlantic with colder air masses from the north. As the warm air is forced to rise over the colder air, it cools and condenses, leading to widespread and prolonged rainfall.

**Characteristics**: Frontal systems, driven by Atlantic depressions, bring frequent and often persistent rain, especially to western parts of the country.

Relief (Orographic) Rainfall in Wales:

**Occurs**: Mainly in areas with highland terrain, such as Snowdonia, the Brecon Beacons, and the Cambrian Mountains.

**Process**: As moist air from the Atlantic moves inland and encounters Wales' mountainous regions, it is forced to rise. The air cools as it ascends, condenses and produces rainfall on the windward side of the mountains.

**Characteristics**: This is the most significant type of rainfall in Wales. The western and upland areas receive heavy rainfall, while the leeward sides (e.g. parts of eastern Wales) are drier due to the rain shadow effect.

{22}------------------------------------------------

In Wales, relief rainfall plays a dominant role due to the rugged landscape, while frontal rainfall is frequent because of the influence of Atlantic weather systems and prevailing south westerly winds. Convectional rainfall occurs less frequently but can lead to heavy showers in warmer months.

{23}------------------------------------------------

# 3.2.4 Global atmospheric circulation

Learners should understand the causes of high and low pressure on the earth's surface, including precipitation trends and seasonal changes:

- low pressure (equatorial low) at the equator leading to convectional rainfall
- high pressure (sub-tropical high) where the Hadley and Ferrel cells meet leading to arid conditions
- low pressure (temperate low) where Ferrel and Polar cells meet, causing depressions moving from west to east across Wales and the UK
- influence of axial tilt on global climate.

Global atmospheric circulation significantly influences rainfall patterns in Wales through several key processes related to wind, precipitation patterns, and temperature differences.

Global Circulation Patterns: The Earth's atmosphere is divided into three main circulation cells in each hemisphere:

- Hadley cell: Near the equator, where warm air rises and moves towards the poles.
- Ferrel cell: Located between 30° and 60° latitude, where air moves from high to low pressure, predominantly westerly.
- Polar cell: Near the poles, where cold air sinks and moves towards lower latitudes.

Wales is situated within the Ferrel Cell, where the prevailing westerlies bring moist air from the Atlantic Ocean. This circulation pattern is crucial in delivering precipitation to Wales.

Prevailing westerlies:

- Moisture transport: The prevailing westerly winds, part of the Ferrel cell, transport moist, maritime air from the Atlantic Ocean toward the UK.
- Impact on rainfall: As this moist air approaches Wales, it is forced to rise when it encounters the higher terrain of the Welsh mountains. This lifting leads to cooling and condensation, resulting in relief (orographic) rainfall. The western regions of Wales, particularly areas like Snowdonia, experience the highest levels of rainfall due to this effect.

Low-pressure systems (depressions) & frontal boundaries:

- Influence of the jet stream: The position of the jet stream, a fastflowing ribbon of air high in the atmosphere, is influenced by global circulation. It plays a critical role in steering low-pressure systems (depressions) across the Atlantic toward the UK.
- Rainfall generation: These low-pressure systems are often accompanied by frontal rainfall. As depressions move in from the

{24}------------------------------------------------

Atlantic, they bring warm and cold fronts. When warm, moist air from the Atlantic meets colder air, it is forced to rise, leading to cloud formation and precipitation. This type of rainfall is common in Wales, especially during autumn and winter.

## Seasonal Variations:

- Summer convection: In summer, the warming of the land can lead to localized convection, where rising warm air creates short, intense thunderstorms. While less common, this convection can also contribute to rainfall in inland areas of Wales during hot days.
- Winter storms: During winter, the presence of strong low -pressure systems influenced by the polar jet stream leads to heavy rainfall and storms, particularly affecting the western and coastal areas of Wales.

### The axial tilt of the Earth:

- The axial tilt of the Earth, which is about 23.5 degrees, significantly influences the climate in Wales and other parts of the world by creating seasonal variations in temperature and daylight.
- Seasonal temperature variations: Due to Earth's tilt, Wales experiences distinct seasons. In summer, the Northern Hemisphere tilts towards the sun, causing longer days and more direct sunlight, which increases temperatures. Conversely, in winter, Wales tilts away from the sun, leading to shorter days and weaker sunlight, resulting in cooler temperatures.
- Daylight length: The tilt of the earth's axis means Wales experiences long daylight hours in summer and shorter daylight hours in winter. These changes affect not just the temperature but also the way ecosystems in Wales, such as plants and wildlife, adapt through the seasons.
- Precipitation patterns: While the axial tilt doesn't directly cause rainfall, the seasonal temperature changes and varying sunlight affect atmospheric circulation patterns. These can influence weather fronts and storm systems, leading to seasonal variations in

- 6. Residual showers: In the wake of a depression, particularly behind the cold front, there may be scattered showers, especially in western regions of the UK. These showers can persist for some time as the atmosphere stabilises.

### Suggested teaching and learning activities

- deliver a weather forecast using a synoptic chart
- interpret synoptic charts and satellite images
- create a cross section through a depression outside as a class
- diagram from memory
- most likely to for different sections of the depression
- living diagram activity
- video
- outdoor learning experience record the passage of a depression in the school's locality.

# 3.2.6 High pressure weather systems – anticyclones

Learners should understand:

- the effect on weather from high pressure systems (anticyclones) in Wales and the UK
- the difference between summer and winter anticyclones, including:
  - air pressure
  - cloud cover
  - precipitation
  - temperature
  - wind speed and direction.

High pressure systems affect Wales differently in summer and winter. Learners should understand the differences and their impact on the weather.

## Summer Anticyclone:

**Clear Skies**: Summer anticyclones often lead to dry, clear conditions due to sinking air, which inhibits cloud formation.

**High Temperatures**: With abundant sunshine, temperatures can rise significantly, resulting in hot weather, especially during the day.

**Light Winds**: Winds are generally light and variable, which can contribute to the feeling of warmth.

**Potential for Heatwaves**: Prolonged anticyclonic conditions can lead to heatwaves, with sustained high temperatures over several days or weeks.

**Possible Nighttime Cooling**: While daytime temperatures are high, nighttime temperatures may drop significantly due to clear skies, leading to cooler evenings.

## Winter Anticyclone

**Frost and Fog**: Winter anticyclones can lead to cold, clear conditions, often resulting in frost at night and fog in the mornings due to radiational cooling.

**Low Temperatures**: Temperatures are generally lower, with chilly and sometimes icy conditions, particularly at night.

**Dry Weather**: Precipitation is usually minimal, leading to dry conditions over extended periods.

**Stable Air**: The stable air associated with an anticyclone can trap pollution and humidity, leading to poor air quality in urban areas.

{28}------------------------------------------------

**Inversion layers**: Inversions can occur, where warmer air traps cooler air at the surface, leading to fog and frost but preventing cloud formation.

### Suggested teaching and learning activities

- deliver a weather forecast using a synoptic chart
- interpret synoptic charts and satellite images
- diagram from memory
- most likely to for different seasons of anti-cyclonic weather
- video
- outdoor learning experience record the conditions during an anticyclone.

- Economic loss: The destruction of property, infrastructure, and livelihoods can result in substantial economic losses for affected areas.
- Displacement and humanitarian crises: People may be forced to evacuate their homes, leading to displacement and increased demand for humanitarian assistance.

## Responses to Extreme Low -Pressure Systems:

- Early warning systems: Meteorological agencies use satellite imagery, weather radars, and computer models to track storm development and provide early warnings to communities at risk.
- Evacuation plans: Authorities often implement evacuation plans to move people from high -risk areas before a storm strikes, minimizing casualties.
- Disaster preparedness: Governments and organizations develop disaster preparedness plans, including stockpiling supplies, establishing shelters and conducting public awareness campaigns.
- Post storm recovery: After a storm, recovery efforts include assessing damage, providing emergency assistance, rebuilding infrastructure and restoring essential services.
- Long term mitigation: Strategies such as improving building codes, investing in resilient infrastructure and restoring natural buffers (like wetlands and mangroves) can help reduce future vulnerabilities.

There are many examples that could be chosen , however learners should have opportunity to engage with all aspects of the content amplification within one example . Possible examples include Hurricane Milton October 2024 and Typhoon Yagi September 2024

### Suggested Teaching and learning activities:

- learners could create a factsheet or information guide about the chosen example
- learners could discuss the sustainability of the chosen responses to extreme low -pressure weather

# 3.3.2 Global hazards caused by extreme high pressure

### Learners should understand:

- the causes (physical and human)
- impacts (social, economic and environmental)
- responses (emergency and future mitigation)
- the sustainability of responses
- of a specific global extreme high pressure weather event.

High pressure events could be extreme droughts, heatwaves, extreme cold spells.

### Causes of extreme high-pressure events:

- Stable atmospheric conditions: High-pressure systems are associated with descending air, which inhibits cloud formation and leads to stable, dry conditions.
- Temperature inversions: In certain conditions, warmer air traps cooler air near the surface, preventing mixing and contributing to extreme cold or heat.
- Climate patterns: Large-scale climate phenomena, such as El Niño or La Niña, can influence atmospheric circulation patterns, leading to prolonged high-pressure systems.
- Geographic features: Mountains and valleys can affect local weather patterns, leading to conditions that promote heatwaves (e.g. in valleys) or extreme cold (e.g. in mountain basins).

### Impacts of extreme high-pressure events:

- Drought: Prolonged high-pressure conditions can lead to reduced rainfall, resulting in droughts that affect water supply, agriculture, and ecosystems.
- Heatwaves: Extended periods of high pressure can lead to significant temperature increases, causing heatwaves that pose health risks, particularly for vulnerable populations.
- Wildfires: Hot, dry conditions increase the risk of wildfires, which can lead to destruction of property, loss of wildlife, and air quality issues.
- Impact on agriculture: Drought and heat can stress crops and livestock, reducing yields and leading to food shortages and increased prices.
- Extreme cold: Freezing conditions can affect travel, infrastructure and healthcare systems.
- Health risks: Extreme heat/cold can exacerbate health issues, leading to heat-related illnesses, increased hospital admissions,

{33}------------------------------------------------

and strain on healthcare systems.

## Responses to Extreme High-Pressure Events:

- Water management: In response to droughts, water conservation measures may be implemented, including restrictions on usage and the promotion of efficient irrigation practices.
- Public health initiatives: Authorities may launch awareness campaigns about heat-related illnesses, advising the public on how to stay cool and hydrated during heatwaves.
- Emergency services: During extreme cold events, emergency services may provide shelter and support for vulnerable populations, such as the homeless and the elderly.
- Wildfire preparedness: In areas prone to wildfires, land management practices, controlled burns and firebreaks can be employed to mitigate risks.
- Policy and planning: Long-term strategies can include investing in infrastructure resilient to extreme weather, improving agricultural practices and implementing climate adaptation policies to address the increasing frequency of extreme high-pressure events.

There are many examples that could be chosen, however learners should have opportunity to engage with all aspects of the content amplification within one example. Examples could include: California drought 2015 and UK Big Freezes of 2009-10 and 2010-11.

### Suggested Teaching and learning activities:

- learners could create a factsheet or information guide about the chosen example.
- learners could discuss the sustainability of the chosen responses to extreme high-pressure weather.

# 3.4.2 Human causes of recent climate change

Learners should know which greenhouse gases are found in the earth's atmosphere and how the natural greenhouse effect works.

Learners should understand how human activity can increase greenhouse gas emissions and cause an enhanced greenhouse effect, including:

- carbon dioxide:
  - burning fossil fuels
  - deforestation
- methane:
  - farming
  - waste decomposition
- nitrous oxide:
  - including industrialisation.

Greenhouse gases are essential in the Earth's atmosphere, without them the planet would have been too cold for life to develop. The greenhouse gases learners should be aware of are:

- carbon dioxide
- methane
- water vapour
- nitrous oxide.

These gases absorb heat radiation and re-radiate it keeping the atmosphere warm – the greenhouse effect.

Learners should be able to understand and identify how human activity is contributing to a greater amount of these gases in the atmosphere – leading to the enhanced greenhouse effect.

There are opportunities to discuss the impact of colonialism and imperialism on the land in some countries, as it is believed that overworking the land through plantations and monoculture has accelerated climate change in these regions.

2011-2020 was the warmest decade recorded, with global average temperature reaching 1.1°C above pre-industrial levels in 2019. Human-induced global warming is presently increasing at a rate of 0.2°C per decade.

### Suggested teaching and learning activities:

- diagrams from memory for greenhouse effect/enhanced greenhouse effect
- flow diagrams to show how human activity leads to increased greenhouse gases.

This is particularly evident in the Arctic<br>and Antarctic regions. |

{38}------------------------------------------------

• Sea -level rise: Global Sea levels have risen due to thermal expansion of seawater and melting ice sheets and glaciers, contributing to increased coastal flooding and erosion.

## Ocean Warming and Acidification

• Temperature increase: Oceans have absorbed much of the excess heat from global warming, leading to increased ocean temperatures.

**:**

• Ocean acidification: Increased CO <sup>2</sup> levels are leading to higher concentrations of carbonic acid in oceans, affecting marine ecosystems, particularly coral reefs and shellfish.

## Changes in Weather Patterns :

- Extreme weather events: There is an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, including heatwaves, heavy rainfall, and hurricanes, attributed to climate change.
- Shifts in climate zones: Observations show shifts in the distribution of climate zones and changes in precipitation patterns, affecting ecosystems and agriculture.

## Ecological Impact :

- Species distribution: Many species are shifting their ranges toward higher altitudes or latitudes in response to changing temperatures and habitats.
- Phenological changes: Changes in the timing of seasonal events, such as flowering and migration, have been observed in various species, indicating a response to climate change.

## Scientific Consensus :

• Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC): The IPCC reports reflect a strong consensus among climate scientists that climate change is occurring and is largely driven by human activities, particularly greenhouse gas emissions.

# 3.4.4 Consequences of climate change

Learners should understand impacts of changing climate globally.

Learners should know the impacts of the changing climate on people and the environment in two contrasting places, such as:

- two countries at different stages of the development continuum
- an island country compared to a continental country
- a country with a coastline compared to a landlocked country
- two regions within the same country.

The impacts of climate change are many and vary depending on location, so a careful choice of case study examples should be made. These locations could be the same as is chosen for 3.5 to save duplication e.g. Wales and Lesotho or the UK and Tuvalu.

Learners should be able to identify the impacts a changing climate could have on both people and the environment in their chosen locations. For example:

- impacts of changes in farming and fishing
- impacts of changes in frequency and severity of extreme weather and flooding
- impacts of changes in rainfall patterns and frequency/severity of drought
- impacts of rising sea levels on coastal communities and in Small Island Developing States (SIDS)
- impacts of future climate refugees.

### Suggested teaching and learning activities:

- groupwork and presentations about impacts in chosen location
- mystery activity e.g. Why are Tuvaluans moving to New Zealand?
- map and graph analysis

Management of the world's oceans requires many different stakeholders to work together at a range of scales. Oceans extend beyond national boundaries so international co-operation is essential. Learners could be introduced to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) as part of their study of global scale conventions, national regulations including bans on single use plastic bags/straws and local actions such as beach cleans.

### Suggested teaching and learning activities:

- roleplay or debate different stakeholder opinions
- discussion and debate over the most sustainable solution to plastic in the ocean
- infographic encouraging recycling
- learners could organise a local beach or river or school litter pick.

# Opportunities for embedding elements of the Curriculum for Wales

## Curriculum for Wales Strands Cross-cutting Themes

**There are many opportunities to include Local, National and International Contexts in GCSE Geography. These opportunities are important to Learners because geography encourages them to think about their sense of cynefin and their sense of belonging to the UK and the wider world. These can be explored through real life case studies in Wales, the UK and from around the world across the different themes in the specification and can help to ensure that learners are knowledgeable about their culture, community, society and the world, now and in the past. Below are some examples of how Local, National & International Contexts can be embedded into teaching and learning:**

**There are many opportunities to include Sustainability in GCSE Geography. These opportunities are important to Learners because considering the sustainability of their actions in relation to global issues such as climate change, deforestation, over-abstraction of resources and population growth have never been more important than they are now. Learners should be encouraged to think how their actions now may relate to the sustainability of life on earth for future generations, something that could and should be considered across all the different themes in the specification. This gives them the chance to become ethical and informed citizens of Wales and the world, showing their commitment to the sustainability of the planet.**

**Below are some examples of how Sustainability can be embedded into teaching and learning:**

| 3.5.1                      | Managing climate change                 | Learners could create infographics comparing the<br>sustainability of different approaches to managing<br>climate change. |
| 3.5.2                      | Managing<br>threats to<br>our<br>oceans | Discussion and debate over the most sustainable<br>solution to plastic in the ocean.                                      |

| Relationships and Sexuality<br>Education | There are many opportunities to include Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) in GCSE<br>Geography. These opportunities are important to Learners because through the study of<br>people and places in geography, a range of different views and ideologies will be encountered,<br>increasing knowledge of these views and encouraging learners to have fair and unbiased<br>opinions based on what they learn. This will help them develop secure values, establish their<br>spiritual and ethical beliefs and an appreciation of other<br>people's values and views, both<br>locally, nationally and around the world.<br>Below are some examples of how RSE can be embedded into teaching and learning: |                            |                                                                                                                                                                       |

**There are many opportunities to include Human Rights Education and Diversity in GCSE Geography. These opportunities are important to Learners because it is vital to consider them when studying key current topics such as migration, settlement growth, and equality of access to resources. Past, present and future issues linked to human rights and diversity must be considered when considering people, places and their interactions between them. Through this, learners can be educated to tackle ignorance and misinformation around this subject and to respect the needs and rights of others, as a member of a diverse society. Below are some examples of how Human Rights Education and Diversity can be embedded into teaching and learning:** *Specification Reference Amplification Example*

## Cross-curricular Skills - Literacy

**There are many opportunities to include Literacy in GCSE Geography. These opportunities are important to Learners because need to be able to communicate effectively in different forms and settings, through both Welsh and English. Learners must be able to write and present succinctly and in depth when required to outline their knowledge and views, make ethical and informed decisions on a range of subjects, write and present fieldwork investigations and explain the concepts they are learning about. Learners should take delight in reading on a range of subjects inside and out of their academic subjects such as geography. This will then prepare them for further study and future careers where these skills will be vital as they get ready to play a full part in life and work.**

**Below are some examples of how Literacy can be embedded into teaching and learning:**

**There are many opportunities to include Critical Thinking and Problem Solving in GCSE Geography. These opportunities are important to Learners because the ability to critically assess resources and arrive at informed solutions to a range of problems is a vital skill learners should develop throughout their study. Learners should aim to question the validity and accuracy of resources and data across the Units in the specification and apply this when making decisions and solving problems related to the key issues they will encounter. Learners should be encouraged to enjoy questioning and solving problems and be given a range of opportunities to do so within the subject of geography.**
