## Qualification Structure

WJEC GCSE Geography consists of 4 units. The qualification is unitised and does not contain tiering. Aside from Unit 1, which is an introductory unit, there is no hierarchy to the order the units should be taught.

|        | Unit title                    | Type of<br>Assessment             | Weighting |
|--------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------|
| Unit 1 | Our Physical and Human World  | Written<br>examination            | 30%       |
| Unit 2 | Developing Fieldwork Skills   | Non-<br>examination<br>assessment | 25%       |
| Unit 3 | Our Dynamic and Diverse World | Written<br>examination            | 30%       |
| Unit 4 | Sustainable Solutions         | Non-<br>examination<br>assessment | 15%       |

### Overview of Unit 2

### Developing Fieldwork Skills

Non-examination assessment – Fieldwork enquiry Set and marked by WJEC 25% of qualification 90 marks

The purpose of this unit is to:

- explore both fieldwork and skills
- develop an understanding of the six-stage enquiry model.

Learners should also develop their mathematical and statistical skills whilst preparing for this Unit. The depth of coverage required of these skills is given in Appendix B on pages 44-45 of the specification.

### Assessment overview

For this assessment learners are required to undertake a fieldwork enquiry following the sixstage enquiry process.

The assignment, which includes several tasks, will be issued to centres in an Assessment Pack via the WJEC portal. Tasks are not intended to change for the lifetime of the qualification. The two selected themes will change annually. Centres can select **one** of the two themes. The themes are published in the Assessment Pack for Unit 2 for five years. This will be updated to ensure there are always five years' worth of themes to allow for forward planning. Centres have the flexibility to decide when during the year learners undertake the assignment. However, it is important that centres select the topic from the year that they plan to submit the work for marking as this may be different to the year that the candidates undertake the assessment. If candidates choose to resit this unit later, they must undertake a fieldwork enquiry for one of themes selected for the academic year they are submitting.

This assessment contributes to 25% of the overall qualification grade and will take 7 hours for candidates to complete the tasks (this does not include the time it takes to undertake the fieldwork). The tasks will be marked out of a total of 90 marks.

This unit will be assessed through an externally set assignment and will be set and marked by WJEC. Assessments must be submitted digitally (they may be handwritten and scanned or completed digitally).

Centres will be expected to carry out fieldwork for the Unit 2 enquiry on one day, outside the classroom and school grounds. This must be accompanied by a fieldwork statement, signed by the Head of Centre, outlining the date, location and nature of the fieldwork conducted. Centres are encouraged to undertake further fieldwork during the course, either to support learning or to practice for the Unit 2 enquiry, however this is not required to be declared on the fieldwork statement.

### 2.1.3 Using maps to locate and plan the enquiry

Learners should be able to plan an enquiry by:

- using appropriate Ordnance Survey (OS) maps to locate fieldwork study sites using four and six figure grid references, ensuring that they have all the correct information (for example, scale, north arrow, key and title)
- interpreting available and relevant Geographical Information Systems (GIS) data.

Learners should be familiar with using and interpreting Ordnance Survey (OS) maps from learning in Unit 1 to inform their understanding about places. It would therefore be useful to teach a quick recap of these skills focusing on the use of grid references and interpreting both physical and human features on the map.

Learners should be taught what makes a good site to collect fieldwork data and all the factors that should be taken into consideration such as representative samples, demands of the enquiry question, health and safety and time constraints.

Learners should also be shown different types of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) data and shown how these can contribute to a fieldwork enquiry such as heat maps across a city or using a GPS app to find the exact location that you planned to collect data on a beach.

Teachers should emphasise the value of using GIS to enhance the accuracy of learner's fieldwork outcomes.

Learning activities may include:

- Give learners two extracts of OS maps and ask them to describe the human and physical landscapes they see.
- Put an OS map extract on the whiteboard and ask learners to identify potential study sides for 3 different fieldwork investigations. Class discussion on whether the identified locations are appropriate or not.
- Provide learners with 2 different types of GIS information and brainstorm as a class how these can be used in fieldwork.

{13}------------------------------------------------

### 2.1.4 Risk and constraint considerations

### Learners should be able to:

- recognise what safety risks need consideration in the field and suggest strategies that will reduce these risks
- recognise the need to be sympathetic geographers, by recognising ethical considerations, including human rights and diversity, when investigating the world around them
- consider the impact of other restrictions on data collection, such as:
  - accessibility
  - availability of secondary data
  - equipment
  - time
  - travel.

Elements of section 2.1.4 could be taught alongside 2.1.3.

Learners should be taught that all primary data collection activities should be assessed for risk, which is usually in the form of a risk assessment. Discussions should be had on how to reduce these risks whilst still being able to achieve the objectives of the enquiry.

Different types of risks should be considered, reminding learners that they need to be sympathetic geographers who make ethical considerations. Risks to themselves, members of the public and the environment should all be considered.

Learners should be aware that when they carry out their own investigation they will have a limited period in which to collect data and therefore it is important to consider these before planning an investigation. Primary data collection sites need to be accessible, safe and have permission from the landowner if not public land.

Within the context of the chosen concept, learners should know what equipment is available to them from the centre and how this will impact their enquiry design.

Learning activities may include:

- Give learners a partially completed risk assessment for a fieldwork activity. Ask learners to complete the risk to themselves/public/environment columns or the mitigating risk column.
- Class discussion about what sympathetic geographers and ethical consideration are. This could also be done in small groups who are provided with a fieldwork context and the groups are to list the necessary considerations.
- On a given topic e.g. speed of river flow, learners need to write down different ways in which this could be measured including equipment required.

### 2.2.2 Methods of collecting primary data

Learners should be able to:

- design primary data collection sheets
- select and use fieldwork equipment to gain accurate and reliable results
- select and use quantitative data collection techniques
- select and use qualitative data collection techniques
- justify the choice of the data collection methods used.

When planning their data collection methods, learners should be encouraged to look at their enquiry question/hypothesis and decide what type of data would help them to answer this question. Then when considering the equipment and time available, they can decide on what data they are going to collect.

Learners should design their own data recording sheets. Thought should be given as to how the data is going to be used which may influence how it is recorded. Therefore, it might be useful to consider section 2.3 when designing recording sheets.

To know what field equipment to select, learners will need to know what instruments measure which data and what equipment centres are able to access. It might be helpful for centres to share equipment in order that learners have the choice of as wide a range of equipment as possible.

Learners need to know the type of data collection techniques (within the context of the chosen concept) ahead of making decisions on what data to collect. Centres should provide opportunities for this within the classroom or school grounds illustrating how and why certain equipment is used. This will allow learners to make an informed choice.

Learners should be taught what quantitative and qualitative data is and how these are used together to produce valid quality data that informs conclusions. For example when investigating flow of people within an urban area, in addition to carrying out a pedestrian count (quantitative data) at various locations, learners could also interview (qualitative data) which might provide some of the reasons behind the quantitative data.

The skill of justification is going to be very important throughout the geographical enquiry and therefore this is something that learners should be taught how to do. In the context of data collection, learners should be able to justify every method of data collection they use and relate this to their enquiry question/hypothesis.

Learning activities may include:

| 2.2.3<br>Methods of<br>collecting<br>secondary<br>data | Learners should be able to:<br>• find, select and use relevant secondary data<br>• ensure the secondary data used adds value to their study in terms of:<br>• context<br>• comparison with primary data<br>• understanding the reliability and validity of secondary data. | It is important that learners understand that secondary data can be just as important as primary data in the context of a geographical enquiry, and it should not be seen as a 'bolt on' piece of evidence.<br>However, to add value, learners need to ensure that secondary data is relevant to their study and furthers understanding. Learners should also have an appreciation of the different ways in which secondary data can be used:<br>• Is the purpose of the secondary data to inform the reader about the location of study? For example, OS maps, meteorological office data, images from www.geograph.org.uk.<br>• Does the enquiry require a comparison over time and therefore the secondary data is providing that comparison? For example, a previous year's data collection sheets.<br>• Does the secondary data provide context to the wider geographical conditions? For example, statista.com, census data.<br>Centres should also show learners how to assess as to the reliability and validity of the secondary data they have found. They should encourage learners to ask questions such as:<br>• Who collected this data and why?<br>• Does the person/organisation have an agenda/message that they want to convey which the data appears to be supporting?<br>• Was the data collected likely to be accurate or is there a high chance of errors? (Professionally collected or by a previous learner) |

{17}------------------------------------------------

Learning activities may include:

- Split the class into small groups. Give each group a different geographical topic to explore. Give the groups 10 minutes to find as many sources as possible of secondary data for that topic. At the end of the 10 minutes the groups swap the information, and each group then must assess the validity and reliability of each secondary data source the previous group had found.
- Give learners three pieces of secondary evidence on a local topic, learners need to look at the secondary data and explain to the class why they would or would not use this data.

| <b>2.3.1<br/>Selecting and using<br/>appropriate<br/>quantitative<br/>and<br/>qualitative<br/>techniques</b><br>Learners should be able to select appropriate<br>techniques to process evidence which aids<br>interpretation, including calculating:<br>distance on mapsmedian, mean, range and modepercentagesother relevant techniques. | The way data is analysed and presented can have a large impact on how easy or difficult it is to see patterns and trends in the data. Selecting the most appropriate way to process data is going to be very important for learners when they are drawing their conclusions and therefore it is important they are taught a range of techniques.<br>At the very least learners should be able to:<br>Plot, measure and draw distances on a map – this might be required during the planning stage of the enquiry or during analysis of data e.g. calculating the distance travelled by the river between two data collection sites. It is vital that this is done accurately and maybe done by hand using an OS map or via a GIS system such as ArcGIS.Calculating the median, mean, range and mode of a data set is a basic statistical analysis of the data. Learners should be shown the benefits and drawbacks of using each in addition to knowing the format the data is required to be in for them to be able to apply the technique.Converting data to percentages is a skill that most learners will have but they should know why they are doing this. Does a particular statistical technique need data as percentages? Does it help with data presentation?In addition to the above techniques, there are many other ways to manipulate data or apply statistical techniques which may improve understanding of patterns and trends. These further techniques are optional and not required to gain full marks. However, some candidates maybe confident to apply them. Such statistical techniques will depend upon the type of data and the context; however, some examples are:<br>Interquartile rangeMann-Whitney U TestManning's nWetted perimeter |

{19}------------------------------------------------

### 2.3.2 Selecting and using appropriate presentation methods for quantitative and qualitative data

Learning activities may include:

- give learners OS map extracts and ask them to calculate various distances on the map
- give learners five sets of varying data, they must select two types of statistical analysis to carry out on the data and provide reasoned judgements as to why those techniques were appropriate
- provide learners with a context, then ask them research a geographical statistical analysis that could be applied to the data.

### Learners should be able to:

- identify the strengths and weaknesses of different forms of data presentation
- select and use appropriate maps
- select and use appropriate graphs
- select and use appropriate qualitative data such as focus group transcripts, field sketches or photographs.

Like the processing of data, it is also important for learners to select and accurately apply appropriate data presentation techniques for both their quantitative and qualitative data. The presentation of data has a great impact on the visualisation of trends and flows and therefore should be selected carefully.

It is also important to note that learners are not required to present every piece of data that has been recorded – the 'selecting' applies not only to the data presentation method but also to which sets of data they decide to present. This should be decided upon through the value that the data brings in being able to answer the key question/hypothesis of the enquiry. Only present data that is relevant.

For quantitative data there are numerous types of graphs and maps which help to illustrate trends and patterns, and the decision over which to include will depend on the type of data collected.

Appropriate graphs that might be considered include:

- bar graph used to present discrete data
- histogram represents data that is discrete or continuous
- line graph used to present continuous data
- scatter graph used to show the relationship between two sets of data
- pie chart used to show data represented as segments of a circle
- kite diagram a graph that shows the frequency of a factor along a transect
- pictograms a graph where the frequency of an image indicates the value of a factor
- star and radial graphs a graph that shows multiple variables on more than one axis

{20}------------------------------------------------

- triangular graphs a graph that displays three different components
- dispersion graphs illustrates the range of variables within a data set
- cross sections and transects a line graph which shows a visual representation of the cross section/transect being measured.

Appropriate mapping techniques that might be considered include:

- choropleth map a map that uses colour to show a variable
- isoline map a map that uses lines to join points of equal value
- flow line map a map that shows movement from one location to another
- proportional symbols map a map with symbols of different sizes that represent data at certain locations.

Learners should also explore different ways of displaying qualitative data. For each strategy, learners should be shown how to display and what is required.

Appropriate qualitative data presentation techniques that might be considered include:

- annotated sketch maps a simplified drawing of a landscape with explanations of features/processes
- annotated photographs a photograph of a study site with added explanations of features/processes
- transcripts from interviews a written record of an interview
- word clouds displays the frequency of keywords mentioned during interviews.

### Learning activities may include:

- Put various examples of different types of graphs or maps on the whiteboard. Ask learners to identify the name of the technique and what type of data it can be used with.
- Provide learners with examples of data sets and ask them to present the data using one of the techniques (that is applicable to the concept they will be investigating).
- Put a photograph on the whiteboard and ask learners to come up and add annotations of things that they see.
- Take learners out into the school grounds and ask them to draw a field sketch map of what they see. On returning to the classroom, ask them to add annotations.

{21}------------------------------------------------

### 2.3.3 Referencing secondary data sources

- Learners should be able to present secondary data in an appropriate way
- consider if stakeholders have a vested interest when reflecting on the reliability of secondary data
- accurately reference all sources of secondary data by citing sources, using a bibliography/resource list.

When learners decide which secondary data they wish to include in their enquiry, consideration should be given to how this is to be presented. Centres should discuss the benefits of presenting secondary data in the format it was found and presenting it in a different format. Ultimately this will depend on the data being considered.

It is important that learners are taught how to consider vested interests and bias in secondary data. They should know what stakeholders are and what influence they might have in how the data is presented.

Learners should be taught what a bibliography is, what it should contain and how to reference secondary resources accurately

Learning activities may include:

- Give the learners a data set. Ask one half of the class to present it to show one viewpoint and the other half to present it to show the opposite viewpoint. Discuss this, and link to how data can be made to show what the writer wants it to show. Discuss ways of avoiding this situation.
- Give the learners several quotes on a topic e.g. different viewpoints on building new houses in a small village. Learners are to recognise the bias in each of the quotes and explain why this person might have this view.
- Give learners several secondary resources (both physical and digital) and ask them to create a bibliography.

## Learning Experiences

Learners should be encouraged to consider the following learning experiences and skills to further develop their understanding, appreciation and awareness of the subject content. Information in the table below provides opportunities for teachers to integrate the learning experiences into delivery.

### make appropriate use of digital technology when completing the qualification, for example through accessing satellite images and digital maps

### Learning Experience Exemplification of Learning Experience

2.1.3 – Digital maps can be used to locate fieldwork data collection sites, together with providing located data which can inform where collection sites might be best located.

Learners could find and select an appropriate map of the area they are planning on studying. They could annotate the map to illustrate the location of study sites or to highlight key physical or human features that will influence the enquiry. Looking at GIS maps may also help to ensure exact locations for study sites or provide further detailed information regarding relevant characteristics at a location.

### Digital mapping websites:

- Ordnance Survey <https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/>
- Bing maps <https://www.bing.com/maps>
- Digimap for Schools <https://digimapforschools.edina.ac.uk/>
- Google maps <https://www.google.co.uk/maps>

### GIS websites:

- Zoopla <https://www.zoopla.co.uk/>
- Quikmaps <https://quikmaps.com/>
- Magic <https://magic.defra.gov.uk/>
- Wundermap <https://www.wunderground.com/wundermap>
- ArcGIS online <https://www.arcgis.com/index.html>

2.3.1 – When processing information, learners want to increase the clarity of data so that patterns or trends can be identified. Use of digital maps can increase the accuracy of measuring distance between collection sites or measuring distance to key influencing features.

Digital calculators can also be used to help learners apply statistical techniques to their data such as mean, mode, median, percentages.

### Digital calculator websites:

- Calculator.net <https://www.calculator.net/>
- Calculator soup <https://www.calculatorsoup.com/>
- 2.3.2 The presentation of data allows for many opportunities to use digital technology to enhance the ability to see patterns and trends.

Therefore, when teaching learners about risk assessments and what should be considered possible themes may include: • how to engage with the public if you want to ask them questions. • being polite if people do not want to engage in questions and thanking those that do • general behaviour and noise levels when in the community • when taking measurements be aware of getting in the way of other members of the public • ensuring any questionnaire/interview designs are inclusive. 2.2.1 – When choosing data collection sites and sampling methods, it should be remembered that the sample of data that is collected should reflect the whole population. Therefore, when sampling features of the population that visit an area, it is important to consider characteristics such as age, ethnicity, gender. Learners need to ensure that unconscious bias does not skew their results. participate in educational visits (other than fieldwork) in person or digitally Opportunities arise throughout Unit 2 for educational visits, both in person and digitally. During the planning stage Google Earth photographs can be used to observe potential study sites suitability. They may also be used as a reinforcement of the wider geographical concepts that are referred to in the analysis and conclusion stages. Pilot visits may also be carried out to practice using equipment or to check on the feasibility of recording sheets/sampling method. engage in collaborative working All sections of Unit 2, during the teaching of skills, and the collection of data in the field.

## Opportunities for embedding elements of the Curriculum for Wales

### Curriculum for Wales Strands

### Cross-cutting Themes

**There are many opportunities to include Local, National and International Contexts in GCSE Geography. These opportunities are important to Learners because geography encourages them to think about their sense of cynefin and their sense of belonging to the UK and the wider world. These can be explored through real life case studies in Wales, the UK and from around the world across the different themes in the specification and can help to ensure that learners are knowledgeable about their culture, community, society and the world, now and in the past.**

**Below are some examples of how Local, National and International Contexts can be embedded into teaching and learning:**

These opportunities are important<br>to Learners because considering the sustainability of their actions in relation to global issues such as climate<br>change, deforestation, over-abstraction of resources and population growth have never been more important<br>than they are now. Learners should be encouraged to think how their actions now may relate to the<br>sustainability of life on earth for future generations, something that could and should<br>be considered across all<br>the different themes in the specification. This gives them the chance to become ethical and informed citizens of<br>Wales and the world, showing their commitment to the sustainability of the planet.<br>Below are some examples of how Sustainability can be embedded into teaching and learning: |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

**There are many opportunities to include Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) in GCSE Geography. These opportunities are important to Learners because through the study of people and places in geography, a range of different views and ideologies will be encountered, increasing knowledge of these views and encouraging learners to have fair and unbiased opinions based on what they learn.

**There are many opportunities to include Human Rights Education and Diversity in GCSE Geography. These opportunities are important to Learners because it is vital to consider them when studying key current topics such as migration, settlement growth, and equality of access to resources. Past, present and future issues linked to human rights and diversity must be considered when considering people, places and their interactions between them. Through this, learners can be educated to tackle ignorance and misinformation around this subject and to respect the needs and rights of others, as a member of a diverse society. Below are some examples of how Human Rights Education and Diversity can be embedded into teaching and learning:**

*2.6.2 Identifying further areas of investigation/questions that could now be asked*

> *(Learners can apply knowledge to different contexts by building on their investigation results to generate more geographical questions)*

For example, in an investigation into the different cultural facilities in town X learners might gain an improved insight into the needs and preferences of other members of the community who are different to themselves (such as by age, gender, religion). From this data they may reflect and discover certain areas of the community are catered for more than others and be able to reflect on how they feel about it.

In the evaluation stage of the geographical enquiry, learners are not only reflective but would also consider what the next stages may be if they were to continue their research. Can they link their study to the wider world and how can their enquiry transcend the local area?

Questions they may ask are:

- Are my conclusions the same as my predicted outcomes?
- If my conclusions are different, what makes them different? Why are they different?
- What makes my study site unique?
- How are my findings similar/different to the wider geographical theories?
- What information would I like to find out next which would increase my understanding of this topic/my local area?
- Could I do this study elsewhere in the UK or abroad?

**There are many opportunities to include Career and Work-Related Experiences (CWRE) in GCSE Geography. These opportunities are important to Learners because many will go on to future careers in a world increasingly dominated by key geographical issues such as climate change and management of resources. Learners must be equipped with the knowledge and skills to understand these issues and to fire their interest in taking on a career that will make a positive difference to a sustainable future. Signposting opportunities like this is the first step to producing enterprising, creative contributors who are ready to play a full part in life and work.**

**Below are some examples of how CWRE can be embedded into teaching and learning:**

### Cross-curricular Skills – Literacy

**There are many opportunities to include Literacy in GCSE Geography. These opportunities are important to Learners because need to be able to communicate effectively in different forms and settings, through both Welsh and English. Learners must be able to write and present succinctly and in depth when required to outline their knowledge and views, make ethical and informed decisions on a range of subjects, write and present fieldwork investigations and explain the concepts they are learning about. Learners should take delight in reading on a range of subjects inside and out of their academic subjects such as geography. This will then prepare them for further study and future careers where these skills will be vital as they get ready to play a full part in life and work.**

To help learners develop this skill:<br>• play the class a recording of someone talking (just audio or with visuals as well, no longer than five minutes) and the class just need to sit and listen<br>• then ask the class to write down the answers to questions that you will ask them once the recording has finished playing<br>• give the class the answers so they can mark their responses<br>• reflect with the class why they may have got some answers incorrect and how they could improve their listening skills. |

### Cross-curricular Skills – Numeracy

**There are many opportunities to include Numeracy in GCSE Geography. These opportunities are important to Learners because using number effectively in different contexts is a key skill geographers need when learning across the topic and collecting, presenting and analysing data from fieldwork investigations. Learning to understand how to interpret data and apply mathematical concepts is a key aspect of both academic study and the world of work and provides geographers with a unique skillset that they can apply to a range of different situations.**

**Below are some examples of how Numeracy can be embedded into teaching and learning:**

Appropriate graphs that might be considered include:

- bar graph used to present discrete data
- histogram represents data that is discrete or continuous
- line graph used to present continuous data
- scatter graph used to show the relationship between two sets of data
- pie chart used to show data represented as segments of a circle
- kite diagram a graph that shows the frequency of a factor along a transect
- pictograms a graph where the frequency of an image indicates the value of a factor
- star and radial graphs a graph that shows multiple variables on more than one axis.
- triangular graphs a graph that displays three different components
- dispersion graphs illustrates the range of variables within a data set
- cross sections and transects a line graph which shows a visual representation of the cross section/transect being measured.

Learners are required to select appropriate methods of presenting data on maps which aids its interpretation. Teachers can provide learners with a range of maps, the type of data that they would be used for and how to draw/interpret them.

Data can be added to base maps manually or through using digital resources: [https://geography.org.uk/curriculum-support/classroom](https://geography.org.uk/curriculum-support/classroom-practice/maps-and-mapping/working-with-digimap-school-examples/)[practice/maps-and-mapping/working-with-digimap-school-examples/](https://geography.org.uk/curriculum-support/classroom-practice/maps-and-mapping/working-with-digimap-school-examples/)

Appropriate mapping techniques that might be considered include:

- choropleth map a map that uses colour to show a variable
- isoline map a map that uses lines to join points of equal value
- flow line map a map that shows movement from one location to another
- proportional symbols map a map with symbols of different sizes that represent data at certain locations.

### Cross-curricular Skills - Digital Competence

**There are many opportunities to include Digital Competence in GCSE Geography. These opportunities are important to Learners because in an increasingly digital world, using digital technologies creatively to communicate, find and analyse information provides geographers with vital skills that set them up for future academic studies and careers. As learners become more digitally competent and aware it is vital that they channel this knowledge into using digital technologies safely and with care and apply it to a range of geographical contexts. Combining opportunities for literacy, numeracy and digital competence in Geography will allow learners to undertake research, creatively present and analyse results and evaluate critically what they find as well as express emotions through different media, ensuring they are set up to tackle future challenges and are ready to learn throughout their lives.**

**Below are some examples of how Digital Competence can be embedded into teaching and learning:**

## Integral Skills Creativity and Innovation

{50}------------------------------------------------

**There are many opportunities to include Critical Thinking and Problem Solving in GCSE Geography. These opportunities are important to Learners because the ability to critically assess resources and arrive at informed solutions to a range of problems is a vital skill learners should develop throughout their study. Learners should aim to question the validity and accuracy of resources and data across the Units in the specification and apply this when making decisions and solving problems related to the key issues they will encounter. Learners should be encouraged to enjoy questioning and solving problems and be given a range of opportunities to do so within the subject of geography.**

**Below are some examples of how Critical Thinking and Problem Solving can be embedded into teaching and learning:**

| Planning and Organisation                                                                                        | There are many opportunities to include Planning and Organisation in GCSE Geography. These opportunities are important to Learners because when faced with investigations to conduct or decisions to make, learners must be able to plan their time, organise their work and meet deadlines effectively. This is a key skill for learners both in geography when faced with decision making exercises, fieldwork investigations and revision for example, and in the wider world as a part of their future life and work. Below are some examples of how Planning and Organisation can be embedded into teaching and learning: |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                                          |

| There are many opportunities to include Personal Effectiveness in GCSE Geography. These opportunities are important to Learners because all four purposes of the Curriculum for Wales combine to increase and improve personal effectiveness for the learner. Being organised and digitally literate, with strong literacy and numeracy skills, a critical thinker and innovator with knowledge of human rights and diversity, sustainability and issues at a range of scales will help learners to become ethical and informed citizens, ambitious and capable learners, healthy, confident individuals and enterprising and creative contributors to society. Below are some examples of how Personal Effectiveness can be embedded into teaching and learning: |                      |                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
