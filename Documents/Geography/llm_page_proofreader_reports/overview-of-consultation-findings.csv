0,3,have decided,Qualifications Wales **have decided** that these qualifications will be introduced in a phased way; WJEC is now developing the qualifications that are to be available for first teaching from September 2025 to meet these requirements.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,"'Qualifications Wales' is a singular entity (an organisation), and therefore requires the singular verb 'has decided' for subject-verb agreement."
1,4,nonexamination,This was particularly prevalent in qualifications where the **nonexamination** assessment is either new or significantly increased.,ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,98,The compound word 'non-examination' requires a hyphen in British English.
2,5,well-being,"Welsh Government's guidance on **well-being**, equity and inclusion [\(https://hwb.gov.wales/evaluation-improvement-and](https://hwb.gov.wales/evaluation-improvement-and-accountability/the-national-resource-evaluation-and-improvement/what-is-the-national-resource/well-being-equity-and-inclusion/)[accountability/the-national-resource-evaluation-and-improvement/what-is-the-national](https://hwb.gov.wales/evaluation-improvement-and-accountability/the-national-resource-evaluation-and-improvement/what-is-the-national-resource/well-being-equity-and-inclusion/)[resource/well-being-equity-and-inclusion/\)](https://hwb.gov.wales/evaluation-improvement-and-accountability/the-national-resource-evaluation-and-improvement/what-is-the-national-resource/well-being-equity-and-inclusion/) describes equity as meaning equitable access to opportunities to perform in assessments, access to the same materials and spaces, unbiased assessment tasks, preventing prejudice or stereotyping and allowing students to access the assessment regardless of their background.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"The term 'wellbeing' is used as a single word on page 4, and consistency should be maintained throughout the document. 'Wellbeing' is increasingly common as a single word in British English."
3,5,nonexamination,"Some stakeholders felt that **nonexamination** assessment can further disadvantage some learners, for example, those who do not have support or access to adequate resources at home.",ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,98,The compound word 'non-examination' requires a hyphen in British English.
4,5,maximalise,"However, one stakeholder group had a different view on what impacted equity, requesting that the GCSEs have a range of assessment methods, focusing on competency-based continuous assessment methods, rather than coursework or mini-tests, to **maximalise** equity.",ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,95,"The correct British English spelling is 'maximise' (or 'maximize' in American English), not 'maximalise'."
5,5,Qualification Wales,"When we submit our qualifications to **Qualification Wales** for approval, we must stipulate how we have managed the balance of manageability, engagement, reliability and validity.",ErrorCategory.FACTUAL_INACCURACY,99,"The official name of the organisation is 'Qualifications Wales' (plural), as used consistently elsewhere in the document."
6,6,nonexamination,"Where this is the case, scanning and uploading of **nonexamination** assessment could be time-consuming, particularly when considering the scale of non-examination assessment across the suite of qualifications.",ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,98,The compound word 'non-examination' requires a hyphen in British English.
7,8,on or volume,"A couple of respondents proposed setting limits on the time spent **on or volume** of work to be submitted for the portfolio; however, after consulting further with stakeholders via our Development Advisory Group, we have decided not to proceed with this but to retain the current flexibility.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The preposition 'on' applies to 'time spent' but not correctly to 'volume of work', creating a grammatical error in parallel structure. It should be 'on the time spent or the volume of work'."
8,9,*.,"The Approval Criteria note that as part of the devising unit, learners must submit a reflective log in a non-prescribed format; this will be compulsory to access the full range of marks**\*.** Our specification writers are aware of the concerns raised within the consultation and are working to ensure that the reflective log does not impede learners' creativity and enthusiasm within the devising unit.",ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,95,"An extraneous asterisk character is present at the end of the sentence, disrupting punctuation."
9,9,states,Respondents noted concerns about the unprepared work(s) in the external examination. The Approval Criteria **states** that 30% of the qualification must be assessed by external examination which must include questions on unprepared works.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,"The subject 'The Approval Criteria' is plural, requiring the verb 'state' for subject-verb agreement, not 'states'."
10,9,Wales and that,"The majority of respondents agreed that the proposed qualification structure and assessment approach is appropriate, that the unit purposes are appropriate and engaging for learners and meet the qualification purpose and aims, that the proposed qualification will support the Curriculum for **Wales and that** the proposed qualification will be manageable for learners.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,A comma (Oxford comma) before 'and that' would improve readability in this long list of parallel clauses.
11,9,states,We are unable to address this as it reflects a decision made by Qualifications Wales; the Approval Criteria **states** that a total of 35% of the qualification must be assessed by digital-only external examination which must be set and marked by the awarding body.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,"The subject 'The Approval Criteria' is plural, requiring the verb 'state' for subject-verb agreement, not 'states'."
12,10,and that the assessment approach is appropriate,"The majority of respondents agreed that the proposed qualification will support the Curriculum for Wales. Respondents generally agreed or partially agreed that the proposed assessment approach is appropriate, that the unit purposes are appropriate and engaging for learners and meet the qualification purpose and aims, **and that the assessment approach is appropriate**.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,90,The phrase 'and that the assessment approach is appropriate' is redundant as the appropriateness of the assessment approach was already stated earlier in the sentence.
13,11,around,Some concerns were raised **around** the number of non-examination assessments. We are unable to address this as it reflects a decision made by Qualifications Wales; the Approval Criteria state that there must be two non-examination assessments that account for 40% of the qualification.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,'About' is generally preferred over 'around' in formal writing when referring to a topic or subject.
14,11,As the Approval Criteria state that one of the non-examination assessments must be marked by the centre and moderated by the WJEC,"Consequently, we have now decided that the fieldwork will be set and marked by WJEC. **As the Approval Criteria state that one of the non-examination assessments must be marked by the centre and moderated by the WJEC**, the Decision Making Exercise will now be marked by centres and moderated by WJEC; this non-examination assessment is 15% of the qualification and is therefore smaller than the fieldwork non-examination assessment at 25%.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The repetition of this clause makes the sentence overly long and clunky; it could be rephrased for conciseness.
15,11,to widen out,"Consequently, we have removed the reference to exploring fieldwork in learners' locality, **to widen out** the area that learners can explore. However, it is likely that most fieldwork enquiries will take place in the local area.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,'To widen' is more concise and grammatically sufficient than 'to widen out'.
16,11,being mindful of,"We propose to explore this further in the next stage of development **being mindful of** fairness, the ability to differentiate, coverage and the need for reading time.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The word 'being' is often redundant in this construction; 'mindful of' is sufficient.
17,11,submission we,Following feedback on digital **submission we** will be exploring this further at the next stage of development.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,A comma is required after the introductory participial phrase 'Following feedback on digital submission' to separate it from the main clause.
18,12,"result, and","We have revisited Unit 4 as a **result, and** simplified and shortened the non-examination assessment. The revised version of the non-examination assessment allows centres to devise a title or titles within set parameters, ensuring that the breadth of the period studied is covered in a more manageable way.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The comma after 'result' is incorrect when 'simplified' is parallel to 'revisited'; the sentence should read 'We have revisited Unit 4 as a result and simplified and shortened...'.
19,13,was manageable,Respondents generally agreed or partially agreed that the proposed qualification structure and assessment approach is appropriate and that the proposed qualification **was manageable** for learners.,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,80,"The verb tense 'was manageable' is inconsistent with 'is appropriate' in the same sentence, implying a past state rather than a current, agreed-upon characteristic of the proposed qualification."
20,13,of a range,Some respondents were encouraged by the introduction of non-examination assessment and felt it would help all learners **of a range** of abilities.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,75,The phrasing 'of a range of abilities' is slightly awkward; 'with a range of abilities' or 'across a range of abilities' would be more natural and common.
21,13,and on non-religious,This was not the intention – the qualification will place equal value on religious **and on non-religious** beliefs and philosophical convictions.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The second 'on' is redundant; the preposition 'on' correctly applies to both 'religious' and 'non-religious beliefs' without repetition.
22,13,outline with some,Some concerns were raised about the reference to concepts in our **outline with some** respondents stating that our diagrams were confusing.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,70,A comma before 'with some respondents' would improve readability and clarify the sentence structure by separating the two clauses.
23,14,i.e. human rights,"• Relating to the specific units, some respondents felt there were repeated topics **i.e. human rights**, with some respondents questioning why a religious studies qualification was teaching human rights.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,"In formal writing, 'i.e.' should typically be followed by a comma for improved clarity and adherence to standard punctuation conventions."
24,14,nonreligious,"Unit 3 – Human experience and the world focuses on how environmental issues are approached by people with different religious and/or **nonreligious** beliefs, whereas, Unit 4 – Human rights focuses on ethical/moral, human rights issues from religious and non-religious perspectives.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,Inconsistent hyphenation of 'non-religious' (used on page 13) and 'nonreligious' (used here); standardise to 'non-religious' for consistency.
25,14,"whereas, Unit","...religious and/or nonreligious beliefs, **whereas, Unit** 4 – Human rights focuses on ethical/moral, human rights issues from religious and non-religious perspectives.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,90,"The comma after 'whereas' is superfluous as 'whereas' functions as a subordinating conjunction introducing the clause, and no additional punctuation is required."
26,14,states,"Human rights have historically been an area of study within religious studies, and the Approval Criteria from Qualifications Wales **states** that human rights must be explored through the unique subject lens of religious studies.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"'Criteria' is a plural noun, so the verb should be 'state' (plural) to maintain subject-verb agreement."
27,14,3 of the non-examination,"...change the release dates of Unit 2 and **3 of the non-examination** tasks to May of the first year of study, thus giving learners and teachers more time to prepare.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,70,The phrasing 'Unit 2 and 3 of the non-examination tasks' is slightly awkward; 'Unit 2 and 3 non-examination tasks' or 'the non-examination tasks for Unit 2 and 3' would be more concise.
28,15,Criteria that learners,"It will validly secure the requirements of the Approval **Criteria that learners** must develop their skills from reading a variety of text and media, understand and interpret their meaning and message and allow them to further explore ""Cymraeg and me"", whilst building on the skills and knowledge developed as part of the Core Cymraeg qualification.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,90,"The sentence structure is grammatically incomplete; a verb (e.g., 'state', 'require') or a relative pronoun (e.g., 'which') is missing after 'Approval Criteria' to properly introduce the subsequent clause."
29,15,"media, understand","...develop their skills from reading a variety of text and **media, understand** and interpret their meaning and message and allow them to further explore ""Cymraeg and me"", whilst building on the skills and knowledge developed as part of the Core Cymraeg qualification.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,90,"The sentence requires a conjunction (e.g., 'and') before 'understand' to maintain parallel structure with 'develop' and 'allow' as actions learners must perform."
30,16,represent,Our specification writer for this unit is aware of the concerns and we will aim to include writing that **represent** a variety of perspectives reflecting the diverse nature of Welsh citizenship and its cultures in order to make the unit interesting and relevant to learners.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The verb 'represent' should be 'represents' to agree with the singular subject 'writing'.
31,17,more of an authentic,"This amendment will allow the translanguaging task to be **more of an authentic** and engaging task for learners, to better prepare learners for the world of work and beyond.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The phrasing 'a more authentic' is more concise and natural in British English.
32,17,set text,"In response, we are exploring opportunities to add **set text** to Unit 2 and Unit 4.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,90,"Given the reference to 'Unit 2 and Unit 4', the plural 'set texts' is required to indicate multiple texts or a range of texts."
33,17,award,"Some respondents were not in agreement with the combined Language and Literature approach, the organisation into Single and Double **award**, or the reduction to two assessment objectives.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The noun 'award' should be plural ('awards') to agree with 'Single and Double'.
34,18,nonexamination,Learners will be allowed and encouraged to supplement the anthology texts with their own selections when preparing for the **nonexamination** assessment tasks in Units 3 and 5.,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"The term 'non-examination assessment' is hyphenated elsewhere in the document (e.g., on the same page), so 'nonexamination' should also be hyphenated for consistency."
35,18,double award unit,Assessments based on poetry feature once in the common units and once in a discrete **double award unit**.,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"The term 'Double Award' is capitalised elsewhere in the document (e.g., 'Double Award Unit 5' on the same page), so it should be capitalised here for consistency."
36,18,the comparison of two unseen poems in Unit 1 and Unit 3 requires,The current GCSE English Literature qualification requires the assessment of poetry in two units: **the comparison of two unseen poems in Unit 1 and Unit 3 requires** the comparison of two poems from fifteen specified poems listed for study.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,90,"The sentence structure after the colon is not parallel; it conjoins a noun phrase ('the comparison...') with an independent clause ('Unit 3 requires...'), which creates an awkward and grammatically incorrect construction."
37,18,were considered,"The length of the examinations for Units 1, 4 and 6 **were considered** by some respondents to be too long.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The subject of the sentence is 'The length' (singular), so the verb should be 'was considered' to maintain subject-verb agreement."
38,19,Taking into regard,"Taking into **regard** all comments from the consultation, there was concern that five units may put learners off from opting for a language and that it would appear to be more challenging than other subjects.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The correct idiom is 'taking into account' or 'taking into consideration', not 'taking into regard'."
39,19,take up,Some responses in the consultation referred to non-tiering impacting learner confidence and **take up**.,ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,90,"As a noun, 'take-up' should be hyphenated in British English."
40,19,sub-sub themes,"There was some concern regarding the number of themes (the current spec has 3 broad themes, 8 sub-themes and 18 **sub-sub themes**).",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,85,"For consistency with 'sub-themes', 'sub-sub-themes' or 'sub-subthemes' would be preferred as a compound noun."
41,19,sub-sub themes,"In the revised qualification outline, we have the same three themes and have reduced the proposed number of sub-themes to 8; there are no **sub-sub themes**.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,85,"For consistency with 'sub-themes', 'sub-sub-themes' or 'sub-subthemes' would be preferred as a compound noun."
42,19,35 mins,"However, the current Foundation Tier listening is set at **35 mins** with 5 mins additional reading time, and Higher Tier 45 with 5 mins additional reading time.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,The abbreviation 'mins' is inconsistent with 'hours' used elsewhere and 'minutes' should be written out for formality.

46,20,"school, the","WJEC received 105 responses, with half of the respondents answering on behalf of a **school, the** majority of those indicating that they were a teacher.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,This is a comma splice joining two independent clauses. A semicolon or a conjunction is needed.
47,20,whether,Respondents asked for clarification **whether** Unit 1: Financial Mathematics and Other Applications of Numeracy would permit the use of a calculator.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,75,"Adding 'as to' or 'on' before 'whether' would improve formality and flow in this context (e.g., 'clarification as to whether')."
48,20,calculator permitted,"We can confirm that this is the case, resulting in the GCSE having an overall split of 70% **calculator permitted** assessment, and 30% non-calculator assessment.",ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,90,"As a compound adjective modifying 'assessment', 'calculator-permitted' should be hyphenated."
49,21,foundation tier,Some respondents expressed concern that the proposed duration of 1 hour 45 minutes for the examination of Unit 3 is too long at **foundation tier**.,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,85,"The term 'Foundation Tier' was capitalised on page 19, indicating it is a proper noun or specific designation, and should be consistent here."
50,21,were,The majority of respondents agreed that the focus of the units **were** appropriate and that they were relevant and engaging for learners.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The subject 'focus' is singular, so the verb should be 'was' for subject-verb agreement."

52,21,nonexamination,A number of respondents expressed concern regarding the move away from **nonexamination** assessment to a 2-hour digital exam to assess programming.,ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,90,The compound word 'non-examination' requires a hyphen.

54,22,subreporting,The Sciences Double Award will be designed to support progression to science AS and A level qualifications and the **subreporting** will help centres measure attainment of the separate science disciplines.,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,95,"The term 'sub-reporting' is hyphenated earlier in the document ('sub-reporting of grades') and 'sub-grades' is also hyphenated.
