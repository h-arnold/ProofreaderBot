5,9,supports/impacts on,Learners should also understand how each stage **supports/impacts on** all subsequent stages and therefore the importance of early decisions made.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,90,The use of a slash to combine verbs is informal and awkward in a formal document; it should be written as 'supports and impacts on' or 'supports and impacts'.
6,9,based around,"As the rest of the unit is taught, examples and discussions could be **based around** this concept.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,"While 'based around' is sometimes used informally, 'based on' is the more precise and formally accepted idiom in British English."

24,19,ask them research,"provide learners with a context, then **ask them research** a geographical statistical analysis that could be applied to the data.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The verb 'ask' in this construction requires an infinitive 'to research' after the object pronoun 'them'.
25,20,graphs illustrates,- dispersion **graphs illustrates** the range of variables within a data set,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,Subject-verb agreement error; the plural subject 'graphs' requires the plural verb 'illustrate'.
