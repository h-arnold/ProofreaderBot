2,1,"this, please","Using a treasury tag is the best way to do **this, please** do not staple or glue any extra sheets in.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"This is a comma splice, joining two independent clauses without a coordinating conjunction."

6,1,for example.,"You are still required to complete two days of fieldwork and include these on the centre declarations, but the second day can be undertaken at any time in the year and can be used to support learning during the course **for example**.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,'For example' at the end of a sentence is often awkward; it is better placed earlier or set off by commas.

10,2,Units ready,"We have four very detailed Guidance for Teaching (GFT) documents, written by the Unit writers, covering all 4 **Units ready** to be published in January.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,A comma is needed before 'ready to be published' as it introduces a non-restrictive clause modifying 'documents'.
11,2,school based,There will also be the Pan-Wales **school based** CPD Preparing to Teach events starting in February and finishing in April.,ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,95,'School-based' should be hyphenated as a compound adjective modifying 'CPD'.
