54,40,reduce,Impact on Human Interaction: Overusing automated systems may reduce face-to-face contact in areas such as customer service and **reduce** that personal element that comes from human interaction.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The repetition of 'reduce' makes the sentence clunky; 'and the personal element' or 'and diminish the personal element' would improve flow.
55,40,automated systems,"Digital divide: Systems that use automated systems, such as call centres that require navigation and processing through **automated systems**, may be more difficult for elderly customers.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,Repetitive use of 'automated systems' within a short phrase; 'these systems' or similar would improve conciseness.
