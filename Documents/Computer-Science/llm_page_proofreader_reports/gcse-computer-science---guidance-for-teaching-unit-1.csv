54,40,reduce,Impact on Human Interaction: Overusing automated systems may reduce face-to-face contact in areas such as customer service and **reduce** that personal element that comes from human interaction.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The repetition of 'reduce' makes the sentence clunky; 'and the personal element' or 'and diminish the personal element' would improve flow.
55,40,automated systems,"Digital divide: Systems that use automated systems, such as call centres that require navigation and processing through **automated systems**, may be more difficult for elderly customers.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,Repetitive use of 'automated systems' within a short phrase; 'these systems' or similar would improve conciseness.

104,57,logs identify,"• Network forensics will analyse network traffic and **logs identify** and investigate suspicious activities, security breaches or anomalies that may occur within a system.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The sentence requires a conjunction or a different verb form (e.g., 'to identify' or 'identifying') to connect 'logs' with 'identify' grammatically."

It helps ensure a swift and coordinated response, minimising damage and reducing the risk of data loss.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The sentence incorrectly uses an imperative verb 'Create' as the subject of the verb 'outlines'; it should likely be 'An incident response plan outlines'.

109,61,Subroutines is,Subroutines **is** a program unit/module that performs a particular task.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,"Subject-verb agreement: 'Subroutines' is plural, so the verb should be 'are'."
110,61,is in modular design,This method of programming **is in modular design**.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The phrasing 'is in modular design' is grammatically awkward; 'uses modular design' or 'is an example of modular design' would be clearer.

122,66,all processes,It will repeat **all processes** until the search item is found.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The phrase 'all processes' is vague; 'this process' or 'the process' would be more precise given the context of repeating the search mechanism.
123,67,data structures,Bubble sort is ideal for sorting data that is nearly sorted **data structures**.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The phrase 'data that is nearly sorted data structures' is redundant; it should be either 'data that is nearly sorted' or 'nearly sorted data structures'.

139,75,testing the validation of the software,"This stage focusses on fixing bugs and **testing the validation of the software**, ensuring that it works as intended.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The phrasing is unnecessarily wordy and awkward; 'validating the software' is more concise and natural.
