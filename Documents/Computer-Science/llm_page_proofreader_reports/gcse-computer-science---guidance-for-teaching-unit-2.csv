3,8,real world,Learners should apply abstraction to remove irrelevant information from a **real world** scenario and model the simplified version into an algorithm or program.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,90,"When 'real world' functions as a compound adjective modifying a noun (e.g., 'scenario'), it should be hyphenated as 'real-world' in formal British English."
4,8,Leaners,"Learners should be able to understand the requirements of the program, including data, relationships and constraints. **Leaners** should be able to determine the data which is required to be input, processed and output from the requirements along with the most appropriate methods of storing the data.",ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,100,This is a common misspelling of 'Learners'.
5,8,form context,This will **form context** of the examination and will feature tasks based on the scenario.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,A definite article 'the' is required before 'context' in this phrase to be grammatically correct ('form the context').
6,8,ensure to use,Centres must **ensure to use** only the specified version of Python found within the task.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,90,The phrasing 'ensure to use' is grammatically awkward; 'ensure they use' or 'ensure that they use' is more natural and correct in formal writing.

Indentation and use of white space **improves** and ensures readability and maintainability of code.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The compound subject 'Indentation and use of white space' requires a plural verb, so 'improve' should be used instead of 'improves'."

34,17,of the introduced code,They are required to analyse the improvements **of the introduced code** in the updated solution.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,"The preposition 'of' is awkward here; 'to', 'in', or 'from' would be more appropriate for clarity (e.g., 'improvements to the introduced code')."
35,17,And provide,They are required to analyse the improvements of the introduced code in the updated solution. **And provide** an evaluation of the final solution.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,Starting a sentence with 'And' is informal and grammatically weak in formal writing; it should either be joined with the preceding sentence or rephrased.
36,17,", or changes","Learners should explain the solution**, or changes** made to a solution, by clearly communicating the final solution and the rationale behind the decisions they made.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,90,The comma before 'or' is unnecessary as 'or changes made to a solution' is not an independent clause.

**iterate on their designs creatively.**",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,"This phrase is a sentence fragment that appears to be a continuation of a preceding sentence, separated by another complete sentence."
97,34,real world scenarios,Data and computational thinking are consistent and essential within Unit 2 and being able to effectively use computational thinking techniques to solve **real world scenarios** through the development of algorithms is fundamental.,ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,95,The compound adjective 'real-world' should be hyphenated when it precedes the noun it modifies.
98,34,algorithmic process,"Ensure they include a range of **algorithmic process**, such as sequence, selection and iteration.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The noun 'process' should be plural ('processes') to agree with the quantifier 'a range of'.
99,34,selection and iteration,"Ensure they include a range of algorithmic processes, such as sequence, **selection and iteration**.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,An Oxford comma (serial comma) is generally preferred in formal British English for clarity in lists of three or more items.
100,34,as to how to solve,...new solutions and generate new ideas **as to how to solve** the set problem.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The phrase 'as to how to solve' is wordy; 'how to solve' or 'on how to solve' would be more concise and equally clear.
101,35,algorithms learners,By implementing their **algorithms learners** can practice reinforcing their problem-solving skills.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,A comma is required after the introductory participial phrase 'By implementing their algorithms' for grammatical correctness and readability.
102,35,display the ability,"Through debugging and testing, learners should **display the ability** to test their code and debug errors.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The phrasing 'display the ability' is less formal; 'demonstrate the ability' or 'be able to' would be more appropriate for a formal educational document.
