3,8,real world,Learners should apply abstraction to remove irrelevant information from a **real world** scenario and model the simplified version into an algorithm or program.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,90,"When 'real world' functions as a compound adjective modifying a noun (e.g., 'scenario'), it should be hyphenated as 'real-world' in formal British English."
4,8,Leaners,"Learners should be able to understand the requirements of the program, including data, relationships and constraints. **Leaners** should be able to determine the data which is required to be input, processed and output from the requirements along with the most appropriate methods of storing the data.",ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,100,This is a common misspelling of 'Learners'.
5,8,form context,This will **form context** of the examination and will feature tasks based on the scenario.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,A definite article 'the' is required before 'context' in this phrase to be grammatically correct ('form the context').
6,8,ensure to use,Centres must **ensure to use** only the specified version of Python found within the task.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,90,The phrasing 'ensure to use' is grammatically awkward; 'ensure they use' or 'ensure that they use' is more natural and correct in formal writing.

Indentation and use of white space **improves** and ensures readability and maintainability of code.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The compound subject 'Indentation and use of white space' requires a plural verb, so 'improve' should be used instead of 'improves'."

34,17,of the introduced code,They are required to analyse the improvements **of the introduced code** in the updated solution.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,"The preposition 'of' is awkward here; 'to', 'in', or 'from' would be more appropriate for clarity (e.g., 'improvements to the introduced code')."
35,17,And provide,They are required to analyse the improvements of the introduced code in the updated solution. **And provide** an evaluation of the final solution.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,Starting a sentence with 'And' is informal and grammatically weak in formal writing; it should either be joined with the preceding sentence or rephrased.
36,17,", or changes","Learners should explain the solution**, or changes** made to a solution, by clearly communicating the final solution and the rationale behind the decisions they made.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,90,The comma before 'or' is unnecessary as 'or changes made to a solution' is not an independent clause.
