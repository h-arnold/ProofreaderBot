Therefore,","Appendix A - Removal of reference to duration bar on the on screen assessment in response to recommendation 22 in the RF, where we provided our rationale for removing the timer. **Therefore,** this information was not relevant.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The conjunction 'Therefore' introduces a new independent clause and should follow a full stop, not a comma, to separate it from the preceding descriptive phrase."
2,2,"that,","This was an oversight **that,** we identified when Qualifications Wales flagged contradictory wording on page 19 of the Unit 2 SAMs.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The comma after 'that' is incorrect; 'that we identified' is a restrictive clause and should not be separated by a comma.

5,6,two parts;,For band marked questions mark schemes are in **two parts;** the indicative content and the assessment grid.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,A colon is more appropriate than a semicolon to introduce a list or explanation of the 'two parts'.
6,8,banded mark,The marking of **banded mark** questions should always be positive.,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,85,"For consistency with the suggested correction on page 6, 'band-marked' should be hyphenated as a compound adjective."

9,8,standardising,Standardising material that has already been awarded a mark will be provided during **standardising** and this should be used as a reference material when assessing work.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,75,The noun form 'standardisation' is more formal and appropriate in this context than the gerund 'standardising'.

Show one example of each of the following **examples of code** from the Payroll.py",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The phrasing 'examples of code' is redundant; 'code examples' or simply 'code' would be more concise.
11,10,each code,Award one mark for **each code** referenced.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,'Code' is generally an uncountable noun; 'each piece of code' or 'each code example' would be more grammatically appropriate.

15,15,lower case,Typical test data The data has passed the test because the data entered is in **lower case**.,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"The term 'lowercase' is used as a single word on page 16, and this spelling should be applied consistently throughout the document."

19,23,Used for candidates who have supervised rest breaks (access arrangements) and for individual or cohort issues that may occur during live exams e.g. disruption.,• ensure invigilators can log into Surpass to be able to pause and resume exams during the delivery of on-screen exams. **Used for candidates who have supervised rest breaks (access arrangements) and for individual or cohort issues that may occur during live exams e.g. disruption.**,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,This is a sentence fragment; the participial phrase 'Used for...' lacks a finite verb and a subject to form a complete sentence.
20,24,7-zip,WJEC is unable to support centres that do not use the **7-zip** program.,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"The term '7-Zip' is introduced with a capital 'Z' earlier in the text, and should be consistently capitalised."

24,25,pupils,Copies of instructions for the decryption of zip files should also be available for **pupils**.,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,95,The document consistently refers to the individuals taking the examination as 'candidates'.
25,25,i.e.,"Centres will be sent a communication document to share with candidates on how to decrypt files, the format this document is shared is down to the discretion of the centre **i.e.** digitally or hard copy.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The abbreviation 'i.e.' (id est) should be followed by a comma in British English when introducing an explanation.
