19,10,around,Some concerns were raised **around** the number of non-examination assessments. We are unable to address this as it reflects a decision made by Qualifications Wales; the Approval Criteria state that there must be two non-examination assessments that account for 40% of the qualification.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,'Around' is less formal than 'regarding' or 'about' in this context and could be replaced for a more professional tone.

Consequently, we have now decided that the fieldwork will be set and marked by WJEC. **As the Approval Criteria state that one of the non-examination assessments must be marked by the centre and moderated by the WJEC**, the Decision Making Exercise will now be marked by centres and moderated by WJEC; this non-examination assessment is 15% of the qualification and is therefore smaller than the fieldwork non-examination assessment at 25%.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,90,"This clause is repeated unnecessarily within the same sentence, making the phrasing redundant and clunky."
21,10,due to the time it takes,"However, following discussions with our Geography Qualification Development Advisory Group, we have not increased the weighting as we would consequently have to lower the fieldwork weighting; the Group did not favour this **due to the time it takes** learners to complete the fieldwork non-examination assessment.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The phrasing 'due to the time it takes' is slightly awkward; 'because of the time required for learners to complete' or similar would be more concise and formal.

42,17,not one unit,"As a direct result of this feedback, we have redesigned some of the units so that **not one unit** focuses solely on oracy.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,'No unit' or 'no single unit' would be more natural and concise phrasing in British English.
43,17,students,"We have therefore decided to move poetry to an examined unit in the Single Award, where **students** will respond in writing.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"The document consistently uses 'learners' to refer to those undertaking the qualification, making 'students' an inconsistency."
