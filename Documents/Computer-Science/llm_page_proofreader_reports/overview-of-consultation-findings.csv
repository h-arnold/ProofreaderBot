1,2,have decided,Qualifications Wales **have decided** that these qualifications will be introduced in a phased way; WJEC is now developing the qualifications that are to be available for first teaching from September 2025 to meet these requirements.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"'Qualifications Wales' is a singular entity (an organisation), and therefore requires the singular verb 'has decided' for subject-verb agreement."
2,3,nonexamination,This was particularly prevalent in qualifications where the **nonexamination** assessment is either new or significantly increased.,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,98,The term 'non-examination' is consistently hyphenated elsewhere in the document and should be here for consistency.
3,3,wellbeing,"A notable area of concern in consultation responses and discussions with stakeholder groups links to learners undertaking non-examination assessment across a number of subjects, and the potential negative impact this could have on learner **wellbeing**.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,95,"The term 'well-being' is hyphenated in the official guidance title on page 4, suggesting this is the preferred form for consistency."
4,4,nonexamination,"Some stakeholders felt that **nonexamination** assessment can further disadvantage some learners, for example, those who do not have support or access to adequate resources at home.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,98,The term 'non-examination' is consistently hyphenated elsewhere in the document and should be here for consistency.
5,4,maximalise,"However, one stakeholder group had a different view on what impacted equity, requesting that the GCSEs have a range of assessment methods, focusing on competency-based continuous assessment methods, rather than coursework or mini-tests, to **maximalise** equity.",ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,99,The correct British English spelling for this verb is 'maximise'.
6,4,Qualification Wales,"When we submit our qualifications to **Qualification Wales** for approval, we must stipulate how we have managed the balance of manageability, engagement, reliability and validity.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,99,The organisation's name is consistently 'Qualifications Wales' (plural) throughout the document.
7,4,minimising bias,"Qualifications Wales' Standard Conditions of Recognition also require that our qualifications, as far as possible, secure validity, reliability, comparability, manageability and **minimising bias**, and to ensure that we achieve the optimum balance of these factors in the context of that particular qualification.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,90,"For parallelism with the preceding nouns (validity, reliability, comparability, manageability), 'minimising bias' should be 'minimisation of bias'."
8,5,decision making,"Whilst these are clearly very important considerations, we now propose that we put learner equity at the heart of our design and **decision making** in relation to non-examination assessments.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,"As a compound noun, 'decision-making' is typically hyphenated in formal British English."
9,5,which limit,Our focus on equity may lead to controls **which limit** some of the flexibility that could have helped centres balance some of the manageability concerns.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,"For a restrictive clause, 'that' is generally preferred over 'which' in British English for clarity."
10,5,nonexamination,"Where this is the case, scanning and uploading of **nonexamination** assessment could be time-consuming, particularly when considering the scale of non-examination assessment across the suite of qualifications.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,98,The term 'non-examination' is consistently hyphenated elsewhere in the document and should be here for consistency.
11,5,Spring,We are undertaking further focused work to explore in more detail and will clarify our expectations in the **Spring**.,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"Seasons are generally not capitalised in British English unless part of a proper noun (e.g., 'Spring Term')."
12,5,differed significantly to,"Some of the comments made indicated that the number of hours allocated to some subjects **differed significantly to** the guided learning hours, and this raised concerns around their ability to cover the content in the time they were allocated by their school.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The correct preposition to use with 'differed' in this context is 'from', not 'to'."
13,5,re-sits,"A number of Further Education providers raised concerns around **re-sits**, with particular concerns relating to Mathematics and Numeracy, and English Language and Literature.",ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,90,"As a noun, the standard British English spelling is 'resits' (one word)."
14,6,does not refer,"However, we have reviewed our use of concepts across the outlines and in some cases, where the word does not add value or the Approval Criteria **does not refer** to concepts, we have removed the references.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,"'Criteria' is a plural noun, so the verb should be 'do not refer' to maintain subject-verb agreement."
15,8,*.,"The Approval Criteria note that as part of the devising unit, learners must submit a reflective log in a non-prescribed format; this will be compulsory to access the full range of marks***.** Our specification writers are aware of the concerns raised within the consultation and are working to ensure that the reflective log does not impede learners' creativity and enthusiasm within the devising unit.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The asterisk is an extraneous character and should be removed; the sentence should end with a full stop.
16,8,states,Respondents noted concerns about the unprepared work(s) in the external examination. The Approval Criteria **states** that 30% of the qualification must be assessed by external examination which must include questions on unprepared works.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,"'Criteria' is a plural noun, so the verb should be 'state' to maintain subject-verb agreement."
17,9,that the assessment approach is appropriate,"Respondents generally agreed or partially agreed that the proposed assessment approach is appropriate, **that the assessment approach is appropriate**, that the unit purposes are appropriate and engaging for learners and meet the qualification purpose and aims, and that the assessment approach is appropriate.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,90,"The phrase 'that the assessment approach is appropriate' is repeated unnecessarily, making the sentence clunky and redundant."
18,9,It also states,"The Approval Criteria from Qualifications Wales state that learners need to develop their knowledge and understanding of different business models, technology and the role of enterprise and entrepreneurship from a local perspective. **It also states** that learners must develop 'an understanding of business processes, incentives, and outcomes, within their cynefin'. However, it is our intention to provide guidance on criteria for selecting a suitable business to support centres.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The pronoun 'It' refers to 'The Approval Criteria', which is plural, so the verb should be 'state' (They also state) for subject-verb agreement."
19,10,around,Some concerns were raised **around** the number of non-examination assessments. We are unable to address this as it reflects a decision made by Qualifications Wales; the Approval Criteria state that there must be two non-examination assessments that account for 40% of the qualification.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,'Around' is less formal than 'regarding' or 'about' in this context and could be replaced for a more professional tone.
20,10,As the Approval Criteria state that one of the non-examination assessments must be marked by the centre and moderated by the WJEC,"The Approval Criteria state that one of the non-examination assessments must be marked by the centre and moderated by the WJEC. Consequently, we have now decided that the fieldwork will be set and marked by WJEC. **As the Approval Criteria state that one of the non-examination assessments must be marked by the centre and moderated by the WJEC**, the Decision Making Exercise will now be marked by centres and moderated by WJEC; this non-examination assessment is 15% of the qualification and is therefore smaller than the fieldwork non-examination assessment at 25%.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,90,"This clause is repeated unnecessarily within the same sentence, making the phrasing redundant and clunky."
21,10,due to the time it takes,"However, following discussions with our Geography Qualification Development Advisory Group, we have not increased the weighting as we would consequently have to lower the fieldwork weighting; the Group did not favour this **due to the time it takes** learners to complete the fieldwork non-examination assessment.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The phrasing 'due to the time it takes' is slightly awkward; 'because of the time required for learners to complete' or similar would be more concise and formal.
22,10,widen out,"Consequently, we have removed the reference to exploring fieldwork in learners' locality, to **widen out** the area that learners can explore. However, it is likely that most fieldwork enquiries will take place in the local area.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,'Widen' or 'broaden' is sufficient; 'out' is redundant and makes the phrasing slightly informal.
23,10,submission we,Following feedback on digital **submission we** will be exploring this further at the next stage of development.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,A comma is needed after the introductory participial phrase 'Following feedback on digital submission' to separate it from the main clause.
24,11,whilst,"Some respondents expressed that there was excessive emphasis on Welsh history (Unit 1 – An in-depth study on Welsh history and Unit 4 – Wales and Britain/the UK) **whilst** others welcomed the focus, noting that they felt it aligned with the Curriculum for Wales.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,"'While' is generally preferred over 'whilst' in modern British English for contrasting clauses, making the text slightly less formal."
25,11,states,"We have retained the focus of Unit 1 on specifically Welsh history, in line with the Approval Criteria, which **states** learners must be given an opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge and understanding of Welsh history, along with Wales and the Welsh perspective.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"'Criteria' is a plural noun, so the verb should be 'state' to agree with it."
26,12,was manageable,Respondents generally agreed or partially agreed that the proposed qualification structure and assessment approach is appropriate and that the proposed qualification **was manageable** for learners.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The verb tense should be consistent with 'is appropriate' as it refers to the current proposed qualification.
27,12,of a range of abilities,Some respondents were encouraged by the introduction of non-examination assessment and felt it would help all learners **of a range of abilities**.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The phrasing 'learners of a range of abilities' is slightly awkward; 'learners with a range of abilities' or 'learners of varying abilities' would be more natural and clearer.
28,12,and on non-religious,This was not the intention – the qualification will place equal value on religious **and on non-religious** beliefs and philosophical convictions.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The preposition 'on' is redundant before 'non-religious beliefs' as it is already covered by 'place equal value on religious'.
29,12,states,"The Approval Criteria from Qualifications Wales **states** that learners must develop knowledge and understanding of Christianity (or Catholic Christianity) and at least one other religion to be chosen from the following list: Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism and Sikhism (Sikhi).",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"'Approval Criteria' is a plural noun, so the verb should be 'state' to maintain subject-verb agreement."
30,13,i.e.,"Relating to the specific units, some respondents felt there were repeated topics **i.e.** human rights, with some respondents questioning why a religious studies qualification was teaching human rights.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,"'i.e.' (that is) is often confused with 'e.g.' (for example). Given 'human rights' is presented as an example of repeated topics, 'e.g.' would be more appropriate. If 'i.e.' is intended, it should be followed by a comma."
31,13,nonreligious,"Unit 3 – Human experience and the world focuses on how environmental issues are approached by people with different religious and/or **nonreligious** beliefs, whereas, Unit 4 – Human rights focuses on ethical/moral, human rights issues from religious and non-religious perspectives.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"The term 'non-religious' is hyphenated elsewhere in the document (e.g., page 12), so it should be consistent here."
32,13,states,"Human rights have historically been an area of study within religious studies, and the Approval Criteria from Qualifications Wales **states** that human rights must be explored through the unique subject lens of religious studies.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"'Approval Criteria' is a plural noun, so the verb should be 'state' to maintain subject-verb agreement."
33,13,Unit 2 and 3 of the non-examination tasks,"Consequently, we have decided to change the release dates of **Unit 2 and 3 of the non-examination tasks** to May of the first year of study, thus giving learners and teachers more time to prepare.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,75,The phrasing 'Unit 2 and 3 of the non-examination tasks' is slightly awkward; 'the Unit 2 and Unit 3 non-examination tasks' or 'the Unit 2 and 3 non-examination tasks' would be clearer.
34,14,"develop their skills from reading a variety of text and media, understand and interpret their meaning and message and allow them to further explore","It will validly secure the requirements of the Approval Criteria that learners must **develop their skills from reading a variety of text and media, understand and interpret their meaning and message and allow them to further explore** ""Cymraeg and me"", whilst building on the skills and knowledge developed as part of the Core Cymraeg qualification.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,90,The sentence lacks parallel structure; 'understand and interpret' and 'allow them to further explore' are not grammatically parallel to 'develop their skills from reading'.
35,15,represent,Our specification writer for this unit is aware of the concerns and we will aim to include writing that **represent** a variety of perspectives reflecting the diverse nature of Welsh citizenship and its cultures in order to make the unit interesting and relevant to learners.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,Subject-verb agreement: 'writing' (singular subject) requires the singular verb 'represents'.
36,15,engaging for learners and meet,"Respondents generally agreed or partially agreed that the unit purposes are appropriate, **engaging for learners and meet** the qualification purpose and aims, and that the proposed qualification will support the Curriculum for Wales.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"Lack of parallelism in the list of predicates; 'engaging' is an adjective/participle while 'meet' is a verb, creating an awkward construction."
37,15,states,We are unable to address these points as they reflect decisions made by Qualifications Wales; the Approval Criteria **states** that 50% of the qualification will be assessed through nonexamination assessment and marked by the centre.,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"'Criteria' is a plural noun, so the verb should be 'state', as correctly used later in the document, indicating an inconsistency."
38,15,nonexamination,the Approval Criteria states that 50% of the qualification will be assessed through **nonexamination** assessment and marked by the centre.,ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,95,'Non-examination' is the standard hyphenated spelling in British English.
39,16,set text,"In response, we are exploring opportunities to add **set text** to Unit 2 and Unit 4.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"'Text' should be plural ('texts') to agree with 'opportunities to add', implying multiple items."
40,16,"answering on behalf of a school, the majority of those indicating","WJEC received 164 responses, with half of the respondents **answering on behalf of a school, the majority of those indicating** that they were a teacher.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,"The phrasing is awkward and could be improved for flow and clarity, for example, by adding a conjunction or restructuring the sentence."
41,16,Single and Double award,"Some respondents were not in agreement with the combined Language and Literature approach, the organisation into **Single and Double award**, or the reduction to two assessment objectives.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,'Award' should be capitalised for consistency with 'Single Award' and 'Double Award' used elsewhere in the document.
42,17,not one unit,"As a direct result of this feedback, we have redesigned some of the units so that **not one unit** focuses solely on oracy.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,'No unit' or 'no single unit' would be more natural and concise phrasing in British English.
43,17,students,"We have therefore decided to move poetry to an examined unit in the Single Award, where **students** will respond in writing.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"The document consistently uses 'learners' to refer to those undertaking the qualification, making 'students' an inconsistency."
44,17,double award unit,Assessments based on poetry feature once in the common units and once in a discrete **double award unit**.,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,'Double Award' should be capitalised for consistency with other instances of 'Single Award' and 'Double Award' in the document.
45,17,two units: the comparison of two unseen poems in Unit 1 and Unit 3 requires,The current GCSE English Literature qualification requires the assessment of poetry in **two units: the comparison of two unseen poems in Unit 1 and Unit 3 requires** the comparison of two poems from fifteen specified poems listed for study.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"This is a run-on sentence where a colon is used to join two independent clauses that are not directly explanatory of the first part, creating a grammatical error."
46,17,"different, with analysis/comparison assessed","Furthermore, the nature of the tasks in the different units will be **different, with analysis/comparison assessed** in the examination, and poetry used as a vehicle for the oracy task in Unit 5, which will focus on the discussion of attitudes rather than literary analysis.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The repetition of 'different' is slightly awkward; 'will vary' or 'will be distinct' would improve the flow.
47,17,centre's choice,"There will now be one oracy task based on poetry, including one poem from the period 1600-1900, and one extended writing task based on the **centre's choice** of a play by Shakespeare.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"Given the context of multiple 'centres' making choices throughout the document, the plural possessive 'centres'' is grammatically more appropriate."
48,17,were considered,"The length of the examinations for Units 1, 4 and 6 **were considered** by some respondents to be too long.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,Subject-verb agreement: 'length' (singular subject) requires the singular verb 'was considered'.
49,18,engaging for learners and meet,"Respondents generally agreed or partially agreed that the approach to assessment is appropriate and that the unit purposes are appropriate, **engaging for learners and meet** the qualification purpose and aims.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The adjective 'engaging' is not parallel with the verb 'meet'; it should be 'are engaging for learners and meet' or 'engaging for learners, and meeting'."
50,18,list of grammar,"Some respondents noted that they were pleased to see relevant broad themes, inclusion of cultural and societal awareness in the countries of the assessed languages, the use of high frequency and high utility grammar and core vocabulary, an extensive and comprehensive **list of grammar** and a more skills-centred approach.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,'List of grammar' is awkward; 'list of grammatical points' or 'grammar rules' would be more precise and professional.
51,18,Taking into regard,"**Taking into regard** all comments from the consultation, there was concern that five units may put learners off from opting for a language and that it would appear to be more challenging than other subjects.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,100,"The correct idiom is 'taking into account' or 'taking into consideration', not 'taking into regard'."
52,18,around,- Some concerns were raised **around** the number of non-examination assessments.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,"In formal writing, 'about' or 'concerning' is preferred over the informal 'around' when referring to a topic."
53,18,awarding body,the Approval Criteria state that a total of between 45–50% of the qualification must be assessed through non-examination assessment tasks that are set by the awarding body and marked by the **awarding body**.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The repetition of 'awarding body' can be made more concise by rephrasing to 'tasks set and marked by the awarding body'.
54,18,take up,- Some responses in the consultation referred to non-tiering impacting learner confidence and **take up**.,ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,95,"As a noun phrase, 'take-up' requires a hyphen in British English."
55,18,45 minutes) which,- Some concerns were also raised over the duration of the Unit 3 listening exam (set at **45 minutes) which** was deemed to be too long.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,100,The closing parenthesis is misplaced; it should be after '45 minutes'.

57,19,along with,WJEC will set parameters for text selection **along with** exemplars in each language.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,"In formal writing, 'and' or 'together with' is generally preferred over the more informal 'along with'."

59,19,clarification whether,Respondents asked for **clarification whether** Unit 1: Financial Mathematics and Other Applications of Numeracy would permit the use of a calculator.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The phrasing 'clarification whether' is incomplete; it should be 'clarification as to whether' or 'clarification on whether'.
60,20,foundation tier,Some respondents expressed concern that the proposed duration of 1 hour 45 minutes for the examination of Unit 3 is too long at **foundation tier**.,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"'Foundation Tier' is capitalised on page 18, so it should be consistently capitalised here."
61,20,focus of the units were,The majority of respondents agreed that the **focus of the units were** appropriate and that they were relevant and engaging for learners.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,100,The singular subject 'focus' requires the singular verb 'was' for subject-verb agreement.
