2,5,pre-release brief,"The pre-released brief will be available via the WJEC Portal. The assessment will feature tasks based on the scenario.

This is a unitised qualification.

It is not tiered.

Unit 1 examination will be available in the summer each year. It will be first awarded in 2026.

Unit 2 examination will be available in the summer each year. It will first be awarded in 2027.

It would be most appropriate for learners to complete Unit 2 in the final year of the course. This would allow learners to implement their understanding of computer science concepts developed throughout Unit 1. It would also allow learners to build on the approaches and practices learnt in Unit 1.

The Unit 2 examination will be based on a **pre-release brief** which will be issued to centres in the academic year before the assessment is scheduled to take place (for example, September 2025 for the 2027 examination). Centres have the flexibility to decide when during the first academic year of study to share the brief with learners.
