#### **MARK SCHEME**

## **Guidance for examiners**

## **Generic marking principles**

- Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions).
- Answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous.
- Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen).
- Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind.

## **Positive marking**

It should be remembered that candidates are writing under examination conditions and credit should be given for what the candidate writes, rather than adopting the approach of penalising him/her for any omissions. It should be possible for a very good response to achieve full marks and a very poor one to achieve zero marks. Marks should not be deducted for a less than perfect answer if it satisfies the criteria of the mark scheme.

For questions that are objective or points-based, the mark scheme should be applied precisely. Marks should be awarded as indicated and no further subdivision made.

Mark schemes often list points which may be included in candidates' answers. The list is not exhaustive. The inclusion of 'Credit any other valid response.' (or similar instruction) within mark schemes allows for the possible variation in candidates' responses. Credit should be given according to the accuracy and relevance of candidates' answers.

Appropriate terminology is reflected in exemplar responses in mark schemes. However, unless there is a specific requirement within a question, candidates may be awarded marks where the answer is accurate but expressed in their own words.

#### Easy to manage

• Progress can be easily tracked as each phase has set milestones providing clear indicators of project status and help spot issues early.

## Predictability

• Due to its linear nature, it's easier to predict timelines and costs at the start of the project, allowing for better budget and resource planning.

Award a maximum of **one** mark for a basic description of a weakness of the waterfall approach to system development.

A basic description could include one of the following:

#### Rigid and inflexible

• Difficult to make changes once a phase is completed.

## Late detection of issues

• Testing is done only at the end of the development process.

## Customer involvement

• Limited opportunities for customer feedback during the development process.

#### Risk of project failure

• High risk if the initial requirements are misunderstood.

Award **two** marks for a developed description of a weakness of the waterfall approach to system development.

A developed description could include one of the following:

#### Rigid and inflexible

• Difficult to make changes once a phase is completed, which can be problematic if requirements change over time.

#### Late detection of issues

• Testing is done only at the end of the development process, which can lead to late identification of issues in the project timeline, potentially causing delays and increased costs.

#### Risk management

• Explicitly addresses risk management in each iteration, which helps to prevent potential issues escalating.

#### Flexibility

• Accommodates changes and updates to requirements more effectively than the waterfall model, as it allows for iteration and adaptation, making it more responsive to changing project needs.

## Early prototype development

• Provides opportunities for early prototypes or proof-of-concepts, which can be beneficial for gathering feedback early in the development cycle, reducing the risk of project failure.

Award a maximum of **one** mark for a basic description of a weakness of the spiral approach to system development.

A basic description could include one of the following:

#### Complexity
