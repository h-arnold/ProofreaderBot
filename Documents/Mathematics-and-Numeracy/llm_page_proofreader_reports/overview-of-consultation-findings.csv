0,3,have decided,Qualifications Wales **have decided** that these qualifications will be introduced in a phased way; WJEC is now developing the qualifications that are to be available for first teaching from September 2025 to meet these requirements.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,"'Qualifications Wales' is a singular entity (an organisation), and therefore requires the singular verb 'has decided' for subject-verb agreement."
1,4,nonexamination,This was particularly prevalent in qualifications where the **nonexamination** assessment is either new or significantly increased.,ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,95,"The term 'non-examination' should be hyphenated for consistency and correct British English usage, as it is elsewhere in the document."
2,4,wellbeing,"A notable area of concern in consultation responses and discussions with stakeholder groups links to learners undertaking non-examination assessment across a number of subjects, and the potential negative impact this could have on learner **wellbeing**.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"The document uses 'well-being' (hyphenated) in the title of official Welsh Government guidance on page 5, suggesting this is the preferred and consistent spelling."
3,4,links to,"A notable area of concern in consultation responses and discussions with stakeholder groups **links to** learners undertaking non-examination assessment across a number of subjects, and the potential negative impact this could have on learner wellbeing.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,"For a formal document, 'is linked to' or 'relates to' would be more appropriate and professional than 'links to'."
4,5,nonexamination,"Some stakeholders felt that **nonexamination** assessment can further disadvantage some learners, for example, those who do not have support or access to adequate resources at home.",ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,95,"The term 'non-examination' should be hyphenated for consistency and correct British English usage, as it is elsewhere in the document."
5,5,maximalise,"However, one stakeholder group had a different view on what impacted equity, requesting that the GCSEs have a range of assessment methods, focusing on competency-based continuous assessment methods, rather than coursework or mini-tests, to **maximalise** equity.",ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,95,The correct British English spelling is 'maximise'.
6,5,Qualification Wales,"When we submit our qualifications to **Qualification Wales** for approval, we must stipulate how we have managed the balance of manageability, engagement, reliability and validity.",ErrorCategory.FACTUAL_INACCURACY,95,"The correct name of the body is 'Qualifications Wales' (plural), as used consistently elsewhere in the document."
7,6,nonexamination,"Where this is the case, scanning and uploading of **nonexamination** assessment could be time-consuming, particularly when considering the scale of non-examination assessment across the suite of qualifications.",ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,95,"The term 'non-examination' should be hyphenated for consistency and correct British English usage, as it is elsewhere in the document."
8,8,on or volume,"A couple of respondents proposed setting limits on the time spent **on or volume** of work to be submitted for the portfolio; however, after consulting further with stakeholders via our Development Advisory Group, we have decided not to proceed with this but to retain the current flexibility.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The phrase lacks parallelism; it should be 'on the time spent on or the volume of work' or 'on the time spent on work or the volume of work' to maintain grammatical consistency.
9,9,states,The Approval Criteria **states** that 30% of the qualification must be assessed by external examination which must include questions on unprepared works.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,"'Criteria' is a plural noun, so the verb should be 'state' to maintain subject-verb agreement."
10,10,and that the assessment approach is appropriate,"Respondents generally agreed or partially agreed that the proposed assessment approach is appropriate, that the unit purposes are appropriate and engaging for learners and meet the qualification purpose and aims, **and that the assessment approach is appropriate**.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,90,The phrase 'and that the assessment approach is appropriate' is redundant as it repeats a clause earlier in the same sentence.
11,10,cynefin',"It also states that learners must develop '**an understanding of business processes, incentives, and outcomes, within their cynefin**'.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,"Direct quotes in formal British English typically use double quotation marks for consistency, or the source should be explicitly stated if single quotes are used to highlight a term."
12,11,around,Some concerns were raised **around** the number of non-examination assessments.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,90,'About' is generally preferred over 'around' when expressing 'concerning' or 'relating to' in formal writing.
13,11,As the Approval Criteria state that one of the non-examination assessments must be marked by the centre and moderated by the WJEC,"Consequently, we have now decided that the fieldwork will be set and marked by WJEC. **As the Approval Criteria state that one of the non-examination assessments must be marked by the centre and moderated by the WJEC**, the Decision Making Exercise will now be marked by centres and moderated by WJEC; this non-examination assessment is 15% of the qualification and is therefore smaller than the fieldwork non-examination assessment at 25%.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,88,"The clause is repeated unnecessarily within the sentence, making it verbose and less concise."
14,12,whilst,"Some respondents expressed that there was excessive emphasis on Welsh history (Unit 1 – An in-depth study on Welsh history and Unit 4 – Wales and Britain/the UK) **whilst** others welcomed the focus, noting that they felt it aligned with the Curriculum for Wales.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,90,'While' is generally preferred over 'whilst' in modern formal British English for conciseness.
15,12,states learners,"We have retained the focus of Unit 1 on specifically Welsh history, in line with the Approval Criteria, which **states learners** must be given an opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge and understanding of Welsh history, along with Wales and the Welsh perspective.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,90,The conjunction 'that' is typically included after 'states' in formal writing for clarity and grammatical completeness.
16,13,on religious and on non-religious beliefs,This was not the intention – the qualification will place equal value on **religious and on non-religious beliefs** and philosophical convictions.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The repetition of 'on' before 'non-religious beliefs' is stylistically awkward; 'on religious and non-religious beliefs' would be more concise.
17,13,states,"The Approval Criteria from Qualifications Wales **states** that learners must develop knowledge and understanding of Christianity (or Catholic Christianity) and at least one other religion to be chosen from the following list: Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism and Sikhism (Sikhi).",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The subject 'Criteria' is plural, so the verb should be 'state' to maintain subject-verb agreement."
18,14,i.e.,"• Relating to the specific units, some respondents felt there were repeated topics **i.e.** human rights, with some respondents questioning why a religious studies qualification was teaching human rights.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,90,"'e.g.' (for example) is more appropriate here as 'human rights' is an example of repeated topics, not a rephrasing or clarification. A comma should also follow 'i.e.' or 'e.g.'."
19,14,nonreligious,"Unit 3 – Human experience and the world focuses on how environmental issues are approached by people with different religious and/or **nonreligious** beliefs, whereas, Unit 4 – Human rights focuses on ethical/moral, human rights issues from religious and non-religious perspectives.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,95,Inconsistent hyphenation; the term is generally hyphenated as 'non-religious' elsewhere in the document and for consistency with 'non-religious perspectives' later in the sentence.
20,14,"ethical/moral, human rights issues","Unit 3 – Human experience and the world focuses on how environmental issues are approached by people with different religious and/or nonreligious beliefs, whereas, Unit 4 – Human rights focuses on **ethical/moral, human rights issues** from religious and non-religious perspectives.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The comma incorrectly separates the compound adjective 'ethical/moral' from the noun phrase 'human rights issues'. It should be 'ethical/moral human rights issues'.
21,14,states,"Human rights have historically been an area of study within religious studies, and the Approval Criteria from Qualifications Wales **states** that human rights must be explored through the unique subject lens of religious studies.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The subject 'Criteria' is plural, so the verb should be 'state' to maintain subject-verb agreement."
22,15,"media, understand and interpret their meaning and message and allow them","It will validly secure the requirements of the Approval Criteria that learners must develop their skills from reading a variety of text and **media, understand and interpret their meaning and message and allow them** to further explore ""Cymraeg and me"", whilst building on the skills and knowledge developed as part of the Core Cymraeg qualification.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,"For clarity and parallelism in a series of actions, a comma (Oxford comma) should precede 'and allow them' to separate the final item in the list."
23,15,learners and that the text types are appropriate.,"Respondents generally agreed or partially agreed that the proposed assessment approach is appropriate; that the unit purposes are appropriate, engaging for learners and meet the qualification purpose and aims; that the proposed qualification will support the Curriculum for Wales; that the proposed qualification will be manageable for **learners and that the text types are appropriate.**",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,Inconsistent punctuation in a series of clauses separated by semicolons; the final clause should also be preceded by a semicolon for parallelism with the preceding clauses.
24,16,represent,Our specification writer for this unit is aware of the concerns and we will aim to include writing that **represent** a variety of perspectives reflecting the diverse nature of Welsh citizenship and its cultures in order to make the unit interesting and relevant to learners.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"Subject-verb agreement error; 'writing' is singular, so the verb should be 'represents'."
25,16,nonexamination,the Approval Criteria states that 50% of the qualification will be assessed through **nonexamination** assessment and marked by the centre.,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"The term 'non-examination assessment' is hyphenated elsewhere in the document (e.g., page 18), indicating an inconsistency."
26,16,state,"the Approval Criteria **state** that this is a linear qualification, and that assessment must take place in the final year of the course.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"'Approval Criteria' is treated as a singular entity throughout the document (e.g., 'Approval Criteria states' on the same page), requiring the singular verb 'states'."
27,17,more of an authentic,"This amendment will allow the translanguaging task to be **more of an authentic** and engaging task for learners, to better prepare learners for the world of work and beyond.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The phrasing 'a more authentic' is more concise and natural in British English.
28,17,add set text,"In response, we are exploring opportunities to **add set text** to Unit 2 and Unit 4.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"Given the context of studying 'a variety of literary works,' 'text' should be plural ('texts')."
29,17,Single and Double award,"Some respondents were not in agreement with the combined Language and Literature approach, the organisation into **Single and Double award**, or the reduction to two assessment objectives.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,'Award' should be capitalised for consistency with other instances of 'Single Award' and 'Double Award' in the document.
30,17,single and double awards units,"Given the requirement of the Approval Criteria that a certain percentage of the **single and double awards units** should be common to both qualification routes, we believe that the proposed structure is the most appropriate one to meet these demands.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,'Awards' should be capitalised for consistency with other instances of 'Single Award' and 'Double Award' in the document.
31,18,nonexamination,Learners will be allowed and encouraged to supplement the anthology texts with their own selections when preparing for the **nonexamination** assessment tasks in Units 3 and 5.,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"The term 'non-examination assessment' is hyphenated elsewhere in the document (e.g., earlier on page 18), indicating an inconsistency."
32,18,and offer them scope,"This will remove the expectation that learners discuss issues relevant to their local area, **and offer them scope** to talk about wider issues that interest them.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,90,The sentence lacks parallel structure; 'and will offer them scope' or 'and offer them the scope' would improve clarity and grammatical correctness.
33,18,double award unit,Assessments based on poetry feature once in the common units and once in a discrete **double award unit**.,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,'Award' should be capitalised for consistency with other instances of 'Double Award' in the document.
34,18,Unit 3 requires,The current GCSE English Literature qualification requires the assessment of poetry in two units: the comparison of two unseen poems in Unit 1 and **Unit 3 requires** the comparison of two poems from fifteen specified poems listed for study.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,90,"The second 'requires' creates a redundant and grammatically awkward structure, making the sentence a run-on or poorly constructed."
35,18,"different, with analysis/comparison assessed","Furthermore, the nature of the tasks in the different units will be **different, with analysis/comparison assessed** in the examination, and poetry used as a vehicle for the oracy task in Unit 5, which will focus on the discussion of attitudes rather than literary analysis.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"This is a comma splice, joining two independent clauses with only a comma. A semicolon or conjunction is needed."
36,18,how many tasks would contribute,"We have clarified in the revised outline **how many tasks would contribute** to the submissions for Units 2, 3 and 5.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"'Would' implies a hypothetical situation, but the sentence describes a factual clarification; 'how many tasks contribute' is the correct phrasing."
37,18,were considered,"The length of the examinations for Units 1, 4 and 6 **were considered** by some respondents to be too long.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,Subject-verb agreement error; the singular subject 'length' requires the singular verb 'was considered'.
38,18,1.5 hours each,"Consequently, we have shortened the duration of these exams from 2 hours to **1.5 hours each**.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,'Each' is redundant as 'duration' already implies a single measure for each exam. '1.5 hours' is sufficient.
39,19,engaging for learners and meet,"Respondents generally agreed or partially agreed that the approach to assessment is appropriate and that the unit purposes are appropriate, **engaging for learners and meet** the qualification purpose and aims.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,"The list items lack grammatical parallelism; 'engaging for learners' is an adjectival phrase, while 'meet the qualification purpose and aims' is a verb phrase."
40,19,Taking into regard,"**Taking into regard** all comments from the consultation, there was concern that five units may put learners off from opting for a language and that it would appear to be more challenging than other subjects.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The correct idiom is 'taking into account' or 'having regard to,' not 'taking into regard'."
41,19,awarding body and marked by the awarding body,...assessment tasks that are set by the **awarding body and marked by the awarding body**.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The repetition of 'awarding body' is redundant and can be made more concise.
42,19,mins,"...Foundation Tier listening is set at 35 **mins** with 5 **mins** additional reading time, and Higher Tier 45 with 5 **mins** additional reading time.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,"In formal documents, the full word 'minutes' is preferred over the abbreviation 'mins'."
43,20,have since removed,"However, Qualifications Wales **have since removed** this requirement from the Approval Criteria and the qualification outline has therefore been revised to include translation from the assessed language into English only.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"'Qualifications Wales' is a singular entity and requires the singular verb 'has,' not 'have,' for subject-verb agreement."
44,20,engaging for learners and meet,...that the unit purposes are **engaging for learners and meet** the qualification purpose and aims; and that the proposed qualification will support the Curriculum for Wales.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,"The list items lack grammatical parallelism; 'engaging for learners' is an adjectival phrase, while 'meet the qualification purpose and aims' is a verb phrase."
45,21,which will each sample,...other units **which will each sample** 30% of the qualification's content.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The word 'each' is redundant when used with 'which will sample' in this context; 'which will sample' is sufficient.
46,21,were appropriate,The majority of respondents agreed that the focus of the units **were appropriate** and that they were relevant and engaging for learners.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The subject 'focus' is singular and requires the singular verb 'was,' not 'were,' for subject-verb agreement."
47,21,easy to learn syntax,...widely used in industry and an **easy to learn syntax**.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,88,'Easy-to-learn' functions as a compound adjective modifying 'syntax' and should be hyphenated.
48,21,nonexamination,...move away from **nonexamination** assessment to a 2-hour digital exam to assess programming.,ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,95,'Non-examination' is a compound word that requires a hyphen in British English.
49,22,have announced,"Qualifications Wales **have announced** that a Single Award GCSE Science qualification will be available for first teaching in 2026, a year after the Double Award qualification is available.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,"The subject 'Qualifications Wales' is a singular entity (an organisation), and therefore requires the singular verb 'has' rather than 'have'."
50,22,subreporting,The Sciences Double Award will be designed to support progression to science AS and A level qualifications and the **subreporting** will help centres measure attainment of the separate science disciplines.,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,95,"The term 'sub-reporting' is hyphenated earlier in the document ('sub-reporting of grades') and 'sub-grades' is also hyphenated, indicating a preference for hyphenation for 'sub-' compounds."
51,22,"and,","There was some concern about the proposed approach to the assessment timing for Unit 1 – Bringing the Sciences Together **and,** the appropriateness of the focus of the unit.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,"The comma after 'and' is grammatically incorrect and creates an awkward pause. It should be 'and the appropriateness' or, if a pause is intended before 'and', 'Together, and the appropriateness'."
52,22,sub meetings,"However, WJEC is working with a Development Advisory Group for The Sciences, including **sub meetings** for Biology, Chemistry and Physics, which includes over 20 practicing teachers.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"For consistency with 'sub-reporting' and 'sub-grades' used elsewhere in the document, 'sub-meetings' should be hyphenated."
