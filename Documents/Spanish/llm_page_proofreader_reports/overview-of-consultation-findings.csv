0,3,have decided,Qualifications Wales **have decided** that these qualifications will be introduced in a phased way; WJEC is now developing the qualifications that are to be available for first teaching from September 2025 to meet these requirements.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,"Qualifications Wales is a singular entity, and therefore requires the singular verb 'has decided' for subject-verb agreement."
1,4,nonexamination,This was particularly prevalent in qualifications where the **nonexamination** assessment is either new or significantly increased.,ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,98,The term 'non-examination' should be hyphenated as a compound adjective in British English.
2,5,nonexamination,"Some stakeholders felt that **nonexamination** assessment can further disadvantage some learners, for example, those who do not have support or access to adequate resources at home.",ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,98,The term 'non-examination' should be hyphenated as a compound adjective in British English.
3,5,maximalise,"However, one stakeholder group had a different view on what impacted equity, requesting that the GCSEs have a range of assessment methods, focusing on competency-based continuous assessment methods, rather than coursework or mini-tests, to **maximalise** equity.",ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,95,"The correct British English spelling is 'maximise', not 'maximalise'."
4,5,Qualification Wales,"When we submit our qualifications to **Qualification Wales** for approval, we must stipulate how we have managed the balance of manageability, engagement, reliability and validity.",ErrorCategory.FACTUAL_INACCURACY,99,"The official name of the body is 'Qualifications Wales' (plural), not 'Qualification Wales'."
5,6,nonexamination,"Where this is the case, scanning and uploading of **nonexamination** assessment could be time-consuming, particularly when considering the scale of non-examination assessment across the suite of qualifications.",ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,98,The term 'non-examination' should be hyphenated as a compound adjective in British English.
6,6,the Spring,We are undertaking further focused work to explore in more detail and will clarify our expectations in **the Spring**.,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,Seasons are generally not capitalised in British English unless part of a proper noun. It should be 'in the spring'.

8,9,states,The Approval Criteria **states** that 30% of the qualification must be assessed by external examination which must include questions on unprepared works.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The noun 'Criteria' is plural, so the verb should be 'state' to maintain subject-verb agreement (Oxford English Dictionary)."
9,10,and that the assessment approach is appropriate,"The majority of respondents agreed that the proposed qualification will support the Curriculum for Wales. Respondents generally agreed or partially agreed that the proposed assessment approach is appropriate, that the unit purposes are appropriate and engaging for learners and meet the qualification purpose and aims, **and that the assessment approach is appropriate**.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,90,"The phrase is redundant, repeating a point already made in the sentence, which makes the sentence clunky and less concise."
10,11,around,Some concerns were raised **around** the number of non-examination assessments. We are unable to address this as it reflects a decision made by Qualifications Wales; the Approval Criteria state that there must be two non-examination assessments that account for 40% of the qualification.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,'About' is generally preferred over 'around' when referring to a topic or subject in formal writing.
11,11,at 25%,"As the Approval Criteria state that one of the non-examination assessments must be marked by the centre and moderated by the WJEC, the Decision Making Exercise will now be marked by centres and moderated by WJEC; this non-examination assessment is 15% of the qualification and is therefore smaller than the fieldwork non-examination assessment **at 25%**.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,"The phrasing 'smaller than the fieldwork non-examination assessment at 25%' is awkward; it would be clearer as 'smaller than the fieldwork non-examination assessment, which accounts for 25%' or '(25%)'."
12,11,it takes learners to complete,"However, following discussions with our Geography Qualification Development Advisory Group, we have not increased the weighting as we would consequently have to lower the fieldwork weighting; the Group did not favour this due to the time **it takes learners to complete** the fieldwork non-examination assessment.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,'The time learners take to complete' is a more concise and direct phrasing.
13,11,widen out,"Consequently, we have removed the reference to exploring fieldwork in learners' locality, to **widen out** the area that learners can explore. However, it is likely that most fieldwork enquiries will take place in the local area.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,'Widen' is sufficient and more concise than 'widen out'.
14,11,being mindful of,"We propose to explore this further in the next stage of development **being mindful of** fairness, the ability to differentiate, coverage and the need for reading time.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,"The participial phrase 'being mindful of' is grammatically acceptable but could be rephrased for better flow and clarity in formal writing, e.g., 'while being mindful of' or 'with fairness, differentiation, coverage, and reading time in mind'."

16,12,on Welsh history,"Some respondents expressed that there was excessive emphasis on Welsh history (Unit 1 – An in-depth study **on Welsh history** and Unit 4 – Wales and Britain/the UK) whilst others welcomed the focus, noting that they felt it aligned with the Curriculum for Wales.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,'An in-depth study of' is generally more idiomatic and precise than 'an in-depth study on' when referring to the subject matter.
17,12,in a more manageable way,"The revised version of the non-examination assessment allows centres to devise a title or titles within set parameters, ensuring that the breadth of the period studied is covered **in a more manageable way**.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,'More manageably' is a more concise and direct phrasing.
18,13,was manageable,Respondents generally agreed or partially agreed that the proposed qualification structure and assessment approach is appropriate and that the proposed qualification **was manageable** for learners.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The past tense 'was' is inconsistent with the present tense 'is appropriate' when describing the current state of a proposed qualification.
19,13,on religious and on non-religious,This was not the intention – the qualification will place equal value **on religious and on non-religious** beliefs and philosophical convictions.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The repetition of 'on' is redundant and can be omitted for conciseness.
20,13,this reflects their intentions,We have amended the outline to reflect our intention; we have discussed our intention and wording with Qualifications Wales who have agreed that **this reflects their intentions** for the qualification as described in the Approval Criteria.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,Subject-verb agreement error: 'this' (singular) does not agree with 'their intentions' (plural subject of the verb 'reflects'). It should be 'this reflects its intentions' or 'these reflect their intentions'.
21,13,Criteria from Qualifications Wales states,"The Approval **Criteria from Qualifications Wales states** that learners must develop knowledge and understanding of Christianity (or Catholic Christianity) and at least one other religion to be chosen from the following list: Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism and Sikhism (Sikhi).",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"'Criteria' is a plural noun, so the verb should be 'state' (plural) not 'states' (singular)."

23,14,nonreligious,"Unit 3 – Human experience and the world focuses on how environmental issues are approached by people with different religious and/or **nonreligious** beliefs, whereas, Unit 4 – Human rights focuses on ethical/moral, human rights issues from religious and non-religious perspectives.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,Inconsistent hyphenation of 'non-religious' within the same sentence and document; 'non-religious' is used later in the sentence.

37,17,help support,"Consequently, we have changed the task to a group task to **help support** manageability for centres.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,'Help support' is slightly redundant; either 'help' or 'support' would suffice.
