0,4,other,"As this is an international languages qualification, it carries over many **other** similarities to GCSE French and GCSE German.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The word 'other' is redundant here; 'many similarities' is more concise and natural.
1,4,",","As such, ideas that could be incorporated into teaching and **learning,** can be found in the Guidance for Teaching documents for these qualifications, and we encourage teachers to research these documents for further guidance.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,A comma should not separate a restrictive relative clause from the main verb of the sentence.
2,5,",","The examples given are neither prescriptive, nor exhaustive and teachers can and **should,** deliver the vocabulary through their own engaging and motivating topics, using language in a natural and reoccurring way.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,A comma should not separate the auxiliary verb 'should' from the main verb 'deliver'.
3,5,reoccurring,"The examples given are neither prescriptive, nor exhaustive and teachers can and should, deliver the vocabulary through their own engaging and motivating topics, using language in a natural and **reoccurring** way.",ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,95,The correct term for something happening repeatedly is 'recurring'.
4,6,excluding,"Learners are not permitted to use dictionaries in any part of the assessment, or any other reference materials **excluding** the learner's own notes.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The word 'excluding' is awkward here; 'other than' or 'with the exception of' would be clearer and more idiomatic.
5,7,read aloud,"There will be a teacher booklet that will provide instructions and guidance as to how to conduct the assessment, and WJEC will provide detail as to the **read aloud** and role-play card to be allocated to each learner in the Assessment Pack.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,90,"When 'read-aloud' functions as an adjective modifying 'card', it should be hyphenated for clarity and standard British English usage (OED, Collins)."
6,8,", or","Learners are not permitted to use dictionaries in any part of the assessment**, or** any other reference materials.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The comma before 'or' is unnecessary when connecting two items in a simple list and can hinder flow; standard British English typically omits it in such cases.
7,8,"annually, it will","The Assessment Pack will be updated and released annually**, it will** include an updated role play card allocation table along with the specific period in which the speaking assessments and Unit 2 must take place.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,"This is a comma splice, joining two independent clauses ('The Assessment Pack will be updated and released annually' and 'it will include...') with only a comma."
8,10,mins,Written examination: 1 hour 30 **mins** Set and marked by WJEC 35% of qualification 70 marks,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"The abbreviation 'mins' is used here, while 'minutes' is written out in full on page 11, indicating an inconsistency in formal document style."
9,13,said documents,This guide builds upon the information in the specification and assessment pack to help further your understanding of **said documents**.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The use of 'said' is overly formal and legalistic; 'these documents' would be more natural and appropriate for this context.
10,14,components identify,Separate information into **components identify** their characteristics.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"A conjunction (e.g., 'and') is missing between 'components' and 'identify' to link the two verbs or clauses."
11,14,something that has the same quality as something,Match/Link To choose **something that has the same quality as something**.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The repetition of 'something' makes the phrasing awkward; 'something that has the same quality as another' or 'to find a corresponding item' would be more concise.
12,14,intention making,Review To consider something with the **intention making** changes if necessary.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The preposition 'of' is missing between 'intention' and 'making'.
13,17,cada año? Sin,"Así, la universidad puede<br>costar entre los 680 y los 1 280 euros<br>**cada año? Sin**<br>embargo, en el caso de elegir una universidad privada, los precios pueden<br>aumentar<br>hasta los 18 000 euros.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The sentence 'Así, la universidad puede costar entre los 680 y los 1 280 euros cada año' is a declarative statement and should end with a full stop, not a question mark, especially when followed by 'Sin embargo'."

15,18,respeten a los horarios,"La policía recomienda a los jóvenes que no levanten la voz en el exterior de las tiendas y bares, que bajen el volumen de la música y que **respeten a los horarios**.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"In Spanish, the verb 'respetar' does not take the preposition 'a' when its direct object refers to a thing (e.g., 'los horarios'). It should be 'que respeten los horarios' (RAE)."
16,19,Levels based,### **Levels-based** mark schemes,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,"Compound adjectives preceding a noun should be hyphenated in British English for clarity (e.g., 'levels-based')."
17,19,in writing,AO2: Understand and respond to written language **in writing**.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The phrase 'in writing' is redundant as 'respond to written language' implies a written response.
