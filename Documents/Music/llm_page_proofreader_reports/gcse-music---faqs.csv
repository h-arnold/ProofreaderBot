0,2,program,"A: The specification recommends 120-140 guided learning hours, primarily designed as a 2 year **program** for learners in Years 10 and 11.",ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,95,"In British English, a course of study is referred to as a 'programme', not 'program'."
1,3,Compositions,"A: Candidates may record their Unit 1 performances at any time during the course, and they may work on their Unit 2 **Compositions** from the start of the first year (usually Year 10) when the briefs are released.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,85,"The term 'performances' for Unit 1 is not capitalised, suggesting 'compositions' should also be lowercase as it refers to an activity rather than a proper noun."
2,3,"Unit 1, 2 and 3","A: There is a list of terminology in Appendix B of the specification designed to aid teachers in preparing learners for **Unit 1, 2 and 3**.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,"For clarity in a list of three or more items, an Oxford comma (before 'and') is generally preferred in formal British English."
3,3,"Additionally, they should also know","A: Learners are required to know and understand all of the terms listed in Appendix B. **Additionally, they should also know** and understand any additional terms which relate specifically to their chosen set works.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The words 'Additionally' and 'also' are somewhat redundant when used together; one is sufficient for conciseness.
4,3,which relate,"Additionally, they should also know and understand any additional terms **which relate** specifically to their chosen set works.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,75,"In restrictive clauses (which provide essential information), 'that' is generally preferred over 'which' in British English for clarity."
5,3,Appraising,These additional terms will only be used within the Unit 3 **Appraising** examination in questions relating to the relevant set work.,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,85,"The term 'Appraising' is capitalised here, but earlier mentions of 'Unit 3 examination' do not include 'Appraising' as a capitalised proper noun. For consistency, if it is descriptive, it should be lowercase."
6,3,"time, however it is","There is no penalty for exceeding the time limit, **however it is** important to note that there is more opportunity for mistakes.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"A comma splice is used to join two independent clauses with the conjunctive adverb 'however'. A semicolon or full stop should precede 'however', followed by a comma."
7,4,not not,I have a candidate that improvises or is performing from a tradition which does not **not not**ate music.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,100,Redundant negation; 'does not notate' is the correct phrasing.
8,4,and for accuracy you are assessing,"...and the expected structure **and for accuracy you are assessing** whether the improvisation is ""accurate to the style.""",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,"The phrasing is slightly awkward and could be improved for clarity with additional punctuation or rephrasing, e.g., 'and the expected structure. For accuracy, you are assessing...'"
9,4,or over a bar or write details,"Either correct the notation **or over a bar or write details** of the change e.g. ""melodic variation here.""",ErrorCategory.AMBIGUOUS_PHRASING,90,The phrasing is unclear and could be interpreted in multiple ways; it seems to be missing punctuation or a clearer structure.
10,4,"add, or remove","You can also add or change dynamics, **add, or remove** repeats, cut sections etc.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,Superfluous comma between two verbs joined by 'or'.
11,4,Leaners,**Leaners** must submit a minimum of two performances and a maximum of 4 performances.,ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,99,Misspelling of 'Learners'.
12,4,"Yes, long as","A: **Yes, long as** the teacher who will be assessing the work is present.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,99,Missing the word 'as' to form the correct phrase 'as long as'.
13,5,submitted; meaning,There are no restrictions on how the Reflective Log is to be **submitted; meaning** there is no word count and there are also no restrictions regarding the format in which the log is to be submitted.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,90,Incorrect use of a semicolon to join an independent clause with a participial phrase. A comma or full stop would be more appropriate.
14,5,candidate's,The Reflective Log is assessed out of 6 and is 2.5% of **candidate's** final grade.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"Should be plural possessive 'candidates'' to refer to the grade of multiple candidates, or 'a candidate's' for a singular, but the former is more likely in this context."
15,5,Candidate's,There is no restriction on the amount of time candidates spend on their compositions and reflective log. **Candidate's** work must be submitted to WJEC within the final year of the course.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,Should be plural possessive 'Candidates'' to refer to the work of multiple candidates.
16,5,Be careful that,"There are no marks awarded for lyrics; therefore, it is acceptable to use lyrics from another song, or a poem. **Be careful that** candidates must compose original melodic/rhythmic material for the lyrics.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The phrasing 'Be careful that' is somewhat informal for a formal educational document.
17,5,"permitted, however","A: It is **permitted, however** there can be no credit awarded for the theme, and often the harmony remains unchanged in the variations, and the melody is only marginally altered, so this can be very limiting.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,This is a comma splice; 'however' is a conjunctive adverb and requires a semicolon or a full stop before it when joining two independent clauses.
18,6,Learners,"A: There will be resources published which will outline what **Learners** need to know, in the same way that we have for the set works on the current specification.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,Inconsistent capitalisation of 'learners'/'Learners' within the document. WJEC typically uses lowercase for general references to learners.
19,6,pupils,Q: What range of musical styles are **pupils** expected to know when approaching Unit 3?,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,95,Inconsistent terminology; 'learners' is used elsewhere in the document and is the preferred WJEC term.

Also, 'Learners' is inconsistently capitalised."
23,6,long form,"...will not need to write a **long form** explanation as to why a particular extract is, for example, a Hymn, or baroque, etc.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,'Long-form' should be hyphenated when used as a compound adjective before a noun.
24,6,Hymn,"...a particular extract is, for example, a **Hymn**, or baroque, etc.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,85,Inconsistent capitalisation; 'Hymn' and 'baroque' as musical styles/genres are typically lowercase.
25,6,Whilst,"Q: **Whilst** the focus is on the elements of music, will learners need to know any stylistic content of Western Classical Music?",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,75,'While' is generally preferred over 'whilst' in modern British English for conciseness.
26,6,elements of music,"Q: Whilst the focus is on the **elements of music**, will learners need to know any stylistic content of Western Classical Music?",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,95,Inconsistent capitalisation of 'Elements of Music' within the document; it was capitalised in the preceding answer.
