'Well-being' is generally preferred as a compound noun in British English."
5,4,nonexamination,This was particularly prevalent in qualifications where the **nonexamination** assessment is either new or significantly increased.,ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,95,The term 'non-examination' should be hyphenated as it functions as a compound adjective.
6,5,nonexamination,"Some stakeholders felt that **nonexamination** assessment can further disadvantage some learners, for example, those who do not have support or access to adequate resources at home.",ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,95,The term 'non-examination' should be hyphenated as it functions as a compound adjective.
7,5,noted that they felt that,"Respondents **noted that they felt that** appropriate controls should be in place to ensure that all schools assess fairly, or there could be a lack of confidence in qualification results which would consequently mean learner attainment would have less value associated with it.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The phrasing 'noted that they felt that' is redundant and can be streamlined to 'noted that' or 'felt that' for conciseness and improved flow.
8,5,maximalise,"However, one stakeholder group had a different view on what impacted equity, requesting that the GCSEs have a range of assessment methods, focusing on competency-based continuous assessment methods, rather than coursework or mini-tests, to **maximalise** equity.",ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,95,"The correct British English spelling is 'maximise', not 'maximalise'."

12,9,states,The Approval Criteria **states** that 30% of the qualification must be assessed by external examination which must include questions on unprepared works. Our specification writers are looking at opportunities to use different types of questions and the use of digital assessment to support and augment this aspect and to support the Curriculum for Wales.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"'Criteria' is a plural noun, so the verb should be 'state' to maintain subject-verb agreement."
13,10,that the assessment approach is appropriate,"Respondents generally agreed or partially agreed that the proposed assessment approach is appropriate, that the unit purposes are appropriate and engaging for learners and meet the qualification purpose and aims, and **that the assessment approach is appropriate**.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,"The clause 'that the assessment approach is appropriate' is repeated unnecessarily within the same sentence, creating redundancy."

15,13,was manageable,Respondents generally agreed or partially agreed that the proposed qualification structure and assessment approach is appropriate and that the proposed qualification **was manageable** for learners.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The verb tense should be consistent with 'is appropriate' in the parallel clause, using 'is manageable' for the proposed qualification."
16,13,and on,This was not the intention – the qualification will place equal value on religious **and on** non-religious beliefs and philosophical convictions.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The second 'on' is redundant; 'on religious and non-religious beliefs' is more concise and grammatically correct.
17,14,i.e. human rights,"• Relating to the specific units, some respondents felt there were repeated topics **i.e. human rights**, with some respondents questioning why a religious studies qualification was teaching human rights.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,"In formal British English, 'i.e.' should typically be followed by a comma."
18,14,nonreligious,"Unit 3 – Human experience and the world focuses on how environmental issues are approached by people with different religious and/or **nonreligious** beliefs, whereas, Unit 4 – Human rights focuses on ethical/moral, human rights issues from religious and non-religious perspectives.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"The term 'non-religious' is hyphenated elsewhere in the document (e.g., page 13), so consistency requires hyphenation here."

They should be infinitives (e.g., 'to understand,' 'to interpret,' 'to allow') or gerunds (e.g., 'understanding,' 'interpreting,' 'allowing') to maintain parallelism and clarity."
21,16,represent,Our specification writer for this unit is aware of the concerns and we will aim to include writing that **represent** a variety of perspectives reflecting the diverse nature of Welsh citizenship and its cultures in order to make the unit interesting and relevant to learners.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,"Subject-verb agreement: 'writing' is singular, so the verb should be 'represents'."

25,17,over,There were some concerns from respondents **over** the opportunities for learners to study and engage with a variety of literary works.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,75,'About' or 'regarding' would be more formal and appropriate in this context.
26,17,set text,"In response, we are exploring opportunities to add **set text** to Unit 2 and Unit 4.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"Given the context of 'a variety of literary works', 'set texts' (plural) or 'a set text' (singular with article) would be grammatically correct."
27,17,single and double awards units,"Given the requirement of the Approval Criteria that a certain percentage of the **single and double awards units** should be common to both qualification routes, we believe that the proposed structure is the most appropriate one to meet these demands.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The phrasing is clunky; 'single and double award units' or 'units for the single and double awards' would improve clarity and flow.
28,18,nonexamination,Learners will be allowed and encouraged to supplement the anthology texts with their own selections when preparing for the **nonexamination** assessment tasks in Units 3 and 5.,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,Inconsistent hyphenation of 'non-examination' within the document; compound adjectives generally require hyphenation for clarity in formal writing.

31,18,over,Questions were raised **over** the inclusion of a Shakespeare text.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,75,'About' or 'regarding' would be more formal and appropriate in this context.
32,18,were considered,"The length of the examinations for Units 1, 4 and 6 **were considered** by some respondents to be too long.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,"Subject-verb agreement: The subject 'The length' is singular, so the verb should be 'was considered'."
33,19,equally split response,We asked stakeholders for their preference for a 4- or 5-unit structure and received an **equally split response**.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The phrasing 'equally split response' is slightly informal; 'an even split in responses' or 'an equal number of responses for each option' would be more formal.
34,19,Taking into regard,"**Taking into regard** all comments from the consultation, there was concern that five units may put learners off from opting for a language and that it would appear to be more challenging than other subjects.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,The correct idiom is 'taking into consideration' or 'having regard to'.

45,21,the focus of the units were appropriate,The majority of respondents agreed that **the focus of the units were appropriate** and that they were relevant and engaging for learners.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,"The singular subject 'focus' requires the singular verb 'was', not 'were'."
