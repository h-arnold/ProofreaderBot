# <span id="page-3-0"></span>Task

## Learners are required to:

• perform a minimum of **two** pieces of music giving a total performance time of 4-6 mins (each piece should be a minimum of 1 minute).

## Learners can:

- choose to perform solos **or** independent parts within ensembles, or a combination of both, in their chosen style(s) of music, without a conductor
- choose to perform on any instrument or voice, or use technology, or a combination of these
- choose to accompany themselves
- use a stimulus for improvisation
- use pre-recorded backing tracks, provided that they do not include the learner's part.
- add additional repeats to a performance to meet the time requirements, but these should make musical sense
- submit up to 4 pieces to meet the time requirement

# **Guidance:**

- Audible click tracks should be avoided
- •
- Perform sections of a piece or make cuts if these make musical sense
- Any changes to the score should be clearly annotated before the performance is recorded
- Each piece must be recorded separately. The recordings can be made on different occasions

## Supervision:

- There is no formal supervision required during preparation for the assessment
- There is no restriction on the amount of time learners spend on this unit
- The teacher assessor must be present when the performances are recorded
- Teachers may provide guidance and support to learners to ensure that they have a clear understanding of the requirements and the assessment criteria.

# **Submission:**

Each candidate submission must include:

- An mp3 audio file of each piece performed
- A score or equivalent of each piece performed
- A declaration of authenticity signed by the candidate and the teacher, and a completed mark sheet (please use the template on the website.)

## Weighting:

- There are 78 marks awarded in Unit 1
- Unit 1 makes up 32.5% of the GCSE Music qualification.

{5}------------------------------------------------

# <span id="page-4-0"></span>Information for candidates

You should read the details of the task carefully and ask your teacher for any help you need to understand what you need to do, and how your work will be assessed.

## Suitability of pieces

You may choose the pieces you wish to perform. Your teacher will be able to advise you on whether they are the most suitable. Here are some things to bear in mind:

- The standard level for GCSE Music is equivalent to Grade 3
- You can perform easier or more difficult pieces and be credited for these.
- You can do all of your performances on one instrument, or you can submit a mixture of instruments/voice/music technology performances. Each piece is assessed separately.
- You can perform solo pieces or ensemble pieces, or a mixture of the two. An ensemble should have no more than 8 live performers, and you should play a significant, independent line, not doubled by anyone else.
- You can perform an improvisation, based on a stimulus such as a chord sequence, a melody, a scale etc.
- You must not perform pieces with offensive lyrics, such as swearing, or references to drugs, violence or any form of discrimination.

# **What you need to submit**

For every piece you must have a score or leadsheet which shows the details of what you will perform, so that you can be assessed for accuracy. Without this, there will not be the evidence to award high marks.

Every piece must be recorded, and your teacher must be present. Only audio recordings are required, not videos.

There is no written work in this unit.

You must sign a declaration to say that the recording submitted is actually you.

You can be recorded at any time during your GCSE course, up to the deadline set by your teacher.

# <span id="page-5-0"></span>Information for teachers

## Standard of Pieces

The standard of pieces selected for performance should be broadly equivalent to **Grade 3** of the graded music examinations. Pages 25-32 of this assessment handbook contain descriptions of the levels of difficulty for the range of performances accepted in this qualification. This guidance must be followed when playing pieces **not** listed for graded music examinations. Centres should contact WJEC for advice if they are unable to make a judgement or if a learner wishes to offer a performance not covered by the tables.

## Improvisation

Learners may choose to perform an improvisation to a **stimulus** of their own choice for a solo performance or as part of an ensemble. This may be prepared in advance of the practical assessment or improvised in performance (a stimulus may be a chord sequence, a scale etc.). **A copy of the musical stimulus must be provided for the assessor along with a lead sheet outlining the structure of the intended performance and any performance directions.** The level of difficulty will depend on the content of the improvisation performed.

## Performing and Recording

Learners may perform at any time during the GCSE course. However, centres should ensure that assessment is completed only when learners have undertaken the necessary teaching and learning and developed the required skills and knowledge. Learners do not have to perform all pieces on the same day.

Each piece may be performed on different occasions during the GCSE course or, alternatively, they may all be performed on one occasion.

Each piece **must** be recorded separately in **one unedited attempt**. It is not permissible to perform different sections of the same piece on different days. Second or subsequent attempts are permitted, but the learner must perform the whole piece again.

The recording **must not** be edited after the performance, and unless they are part of a music technology performance there must be no use or addition of effects.

All performances must be kept securely by the centre.

## Authentication

The assessor **must** be present for the recording of all performances, so that the work can be authenticated. All learners are required to sign a Candidate Declaration form endorsing the performance as their own work and centres must countersign that they have taken all reasonable steps to validate this.

## Further information

You should refer to the JCQ Instructions for conducting non-examination assessment for further information on managing assessment within our GCSE Qualifications.

{7}------------------------------------------------

## Scores

A copy of the score or equivalent for all pieces **must** be provided for the assessor **before** the performance is recorded. This can be in stave notation, tab, or any other type of notation appropriate to the piece, and to allow a fair assessment of accuracy must include:

- the pitch and rhythm of the part performed by the learner
- performance directions.

If necessary, please provide a guide to interpretation. A transcription of a piece created by the learner or teacher in advance of the performance is acceptable. In the case of an improvisation a lead sheet and a copy of the stimulus should be provided. For a DJ performance, or a performance using technology such as a launchpad or loop station, a detailed and accurate lead sheet must be provided. Centres should contact WJEC for advice about notation for specific types of performance not covered by the guidance above. An audio or video guide track will **not** be acceptable as an alternative to a score.

## Timing

Candidates should perform pieces of at least one minute. A piece which is significantly below the one minute minimum performance duration will be unlikely to demonstrate evidence of the skills required to access marks in the higher bands of the assessment criteria.

The overall submission must be at least 4 minutes, or candidates will face a penalty. Each piece should be timed separately, and then the total calculated. Timing starts from the learner's first note of the piece and finishes after their final note. Long passages (e.g. introductions or instrumental verses) where the candidate is not performing, should not be counted in the timing.

Repeats can be added, but they must make musical sense and be marked clearly on the score before the performance.

The performance submission has a suggested maximum duration of 6 minutes. There is no penalty incurred for exceeding the time limit, and learners must submit at least 2 pieces, even if this goes beyond 6 minutes.

### Unit 1 Performing Timing Sheet

Centres must submit a form containing details of the timings of all candidates' performances with the moderation sample. This form is available from the website and should be completed with the details of every candidate and the total duration of their performing submission, and any penalties imposed by the centre prior to submission. It will be used by the moderator to check that penalties are correct.

{8}------------------------------------------------

# <span id="page-7-0"></span>Assessment (and calculating the final mark)

The total mark for this unit is 78. Each piece performed should be marked out of 39, using the banded marking scheme on pages 13 onwards.

Learners must submit at least 2 pieces, which are individually marked out of 39.

The level of difficulty of each piece must be determined using the descriptors on pages 25 onwards, and the mark awarded for the performance must be scaled up (if it is more difficult than Grade 3) or down (if it is easier than Grade 3) according to the table on pages 33-34 to give a final mark for the performance.

When more than two pieces are performed, the total mark is divided by the number of pieces and multiplied by two, to achieve a final mark out of 78. For example, (three pieces submitted):

```
36+30+34 = 100
100/3 = 33.3
33.3 x 2 = 66.6 (round up if 0.5 or above)
Final mark = 67
```

If the learner only submits 1 piece as part of their portfolio, the second, missing piece is awarded 0 marks.

A timing penalty should also be applied if a submission is below 4 minutes, using the table on page 35.

The performance submission has a suggested maximum duration of 6 minutes. There is no penalty incurred for exceeding the time limit, and learners must submit at least 2 pieces, even if this goes beyond 6 minutes. Timing starts from the learner's first note and finishes after their final note. Centres need to be aware that long passages (e.g. introductions or instrumental verses) where the assessed learner is not performing, should not be counted in the timing.

Repeats can be added, but they must make musical sense and be marked clearly on the score before the performance.

Centres are responsible for assessing the performance and should listen to the entire submission. The moderator will listen for at least 6 minutes to inform their decisions on the accuracy of the centre assessment.

## For each performance:

- the appropriate band for each column should be established by determining which performance descriptor best reflects the learner's performance
- the appropriate mark within the band should then be established by determining the extent to which the learner has met the criteria within the relevant band
- the marks awarded for each performance may reflect different bands across the assessment criteria, for example, a learner may achieve band 4 in column 1, band 4 in column 2 and band 3 in column 3.
- any adjustment for level of difficulty should be applied to give a final mark for the performance.

{9}------------------------------------------------

It should be noted that the bands have been designed to assist the marking process by identifying individual levels of achievement and they do not correlate with grade boundaries.

Learners who perform pieces that are significantly below the standard difficulty level for this specification (which is equivalent to Grade 3) may not demonstrate sufficient skills to meet the criteria in the upper marking bands.

{10}------------------------------------------------

# <span id="page-9-0"></span>Criteria for Assessment of Solo, Ensemble and Technology-Based Performance

There are criteria for assessment of solo, ensemble and technology-based performances. Centres should use the appropriate criteria to assess each performance.

Performing an ensemble is not compulsory, however learners may choose to perform one or more ensemble pieces.

Performing a solo is also not compulsory. A submission could be:

- all solo
- all ensemble
- some solo and some ensemble
- all technology based
- all "traditional" performance (ie non-technology based)
- some technology and some traditional performance(s)

It is important to recognise which criteria should be applied to each performance, so the following guidance will aid teachers in making that judgement.

## Solo Performance

If there is only one live performer, this is a solo

- a solo performance may be **either** accompanied **or** unaccompanied
- the accompaniment can be live or a backing track
- the accompanist need not be taking the assessment
- the score of the accompaniment need not be submitted

## Ensemble Performance

An ensemble performance may be on any instrument, voice, or technology-based option. In an ensemble, the learner is required to:

- perform in a group of between **two** and **eight** live performers. The other members of the ensemble need not be taking the assessment
- perform a significant **individual** part which is **not** doubled, at the same time as other member(s) of the ensemble
- perform accompanied **or** unaccompanied as part of a group but **not** be conducted (the accompaniment can be live **or** a backing track). An accompanist should not take the total number of live performers above eight.

Accompanying a solo is an acceptable ensemble when the **learner is the accompanist** but not when the learner is the soloist.

## Technology-based Performance

Learners may choose to offer a technology-based performance for this unit. Technologybased performances include:

- DJ-ing
- 'push-units'
- sequencing
- use of loop stations
- other appropriate technology-based formats.

{11}------------------------------------------------

Note that it will be necessary to submit the score and/or lead sheet from which the learner performed/realised the piece.

## Assessment Criteria

There are performing assessment grids for different types of performance:

- Solo Performance
- Ensemble Performance
- Music Technology

The first two columns – Accuracy, and Technical Control - are the same in all three of the grids.

## Column 1 – Accuracy

All learners are assessed on accuracy of rhythm and/or pitch, as appropriate, in relation to a notated score. Where no score is available, the centre is expected to provide a detailed lead sheet including chords, melody (rhythm and pitch), lyrics (if appropriate), tempo and performance directions.

An "audio guide" or "reference track" will not be acceptable in lieu of a score as this does not offer a fair assessment for all learners.

Where learners plan to add embellishments, this should be noted on the score or lead sheet in advance of the performance. When assessing accuracy of these performances against a lead sheet, assessors will use their professional judgement to judge the accuracy of the performance within the stylistic context, considering such factors as the maintenance of the pulse and intonation.

In performances where it may not be possible to provide details of melody and chords on a lead sheet (for example, beat-box, DJ, or rap), centres must provide appropriate details of rhythm, tempo and performance directions/techniques, with timings as necessary, to allow for a fair assessment of their accuracy. In such performances, learners will be assessed on their ability to keep time with a backing track, make smooth transitions, keep an appropriate tempo/timing, and follow performance and technique directions, as appropriate to the piece.

Learners offering **improvisation** will be assessed on whether they are playing accurately within the stated stimulus and the lead sheet, for example, whether the performance fits the chord progression or uses the notes of the chosen scale, as well as if they are maintaining the tempo and pulse.

All learners are assessed on their ability to perform fluently and at an appropriate tempo throughout the piece.

All learners are assessed on their ability to follow performing/technique directions, accurately and appropriately throughout the piece.

{12}------------------------------------------------

### Column 2: Technical Control

**Control of playing Instrumental technique / Vocal technique / Realisation technique** The first bullet point on the assessment grid assesses the learner's ability to control instrumental/vocal technique or technical equipment, to meet the demands of the music they are performing. Assessors must consider how well **relevant** techniques are used within the performance, as appropriate to the style of the music. Centres should contact WJEC for advice if they are unsure about the use of a particular technique.

### Intonation (where appropriate)

The second bullet point on the assessment grid assesses the learner's ability to control the intonation of the instrument, equipment, or voice to meet the demands of the piece they are performing. Learners need to be aware of their intonation throughout a performance and potentially make adjustments to ensure that notes are in tune.

## Control of timbre (tone quality)

The third bullet point on the assessment grid assesses the learner's ability to **control** the timbre and tone quality of the instrument, equipment, or voice in the performance. This includes the learner's ability to affect and vary the tone quality during the piece, as appropriate to the style of the music. Assessors must consider the following as appropriate to the piece and instrument/voice/equipment (this list is not exhaustive, and learners do not need to cover all points in a performance):

- how well the tone quality is controlled across the range of the instrument, equipment, or voice
- the ability to sustain tone quality throughout the performance
- the use of tone quality as appropriate to the style of the piece
- the ability to vary the tone quality as appropriate to the piece and realise the performance markings
- the use of appropriate articulation/techniques
- the choice and mix of sound sources
- the use of effects to manipulate timbre
- the use of amplification

### Column 3: Expression (solo performances)

All learners are assessed on their ability to communicate a performance to the audience. Assessors should consider the following when assessing expression:

- the style of the music being performed, including performance conventions and consistency of style
- the ability of the learner to sustain the rapport with the audience throughout the performance, including the ability to communicate musically, shaping the performance using the elements of music
- the ability of the learner to work effectively with an accompanist or pre-recorded tracks if included
- the ability of the learner to project their performance.

{13}------------------------------------------------

### Column 3: Ensemble skills (ensemble performances)

All learners are assessed on their ability to communicate a performance to the audience. Assessors should consider the following when assessing expression:

- the style of the music being performed, including performance conventions and consistency of style
- the ability of the learner to sustain the rapport with the audience throughout the performance, including the ability to communicate musically, shaping the performance using the elements of music
- the ability of the learner to work effectively with other performers and pre-recorded tracks if a backing track is included
- the ability of the learner to project a balanced ensemble performance

## Column 3: Mixing and Mastering (Music Technology)

All learners are assessed on their ability to communicate a performance to the audience. Assessors should consider the following when assessing expression:

- the style of the music being performed, including performance conventions and consistency of style
- the ability of the learner to sustain the rapport with the audience throughout the performance, including the ability to communicate musically, shaping the performance etc. using the elements of music and music technology
- the ability of the learner to work effectively with live/pre-recorded tracks
- the ability of the learner to successfully mix and master their tracks
- the ability of the learner to project a balanced music technology performance.

# Levels of difficulty

All pieces which are listed on an accredited graded music examination syllabus will be accepted at that level if they are performed **in full using the specified editions**. The difficulty level of any **other** piece of music not contained in a graded music syllabus must be determined using the descriptors in the tables on pages 25-32. If a piece is edited to simplify or remove the more challenging sections, this will affect the level of difficulty.

The descriptors are not exhaustive; neither will every piece contain all features listed, for example a Grade 3 standard oboe piece may cover a smaller range than a Grade 3 standard flute piece. When selecting the standard for each piece, teachers should use their professional judgement and look for the best fit.

Centres should be aware that candidates must perform music at a difficulty level suitable for a KS4 course in music – a performance that cannot demonstrate sufficient skills or content will be unlikely to meet the criteria for credit. A piece which is significantly below Grade 3 standard will be unlikely to demonstrate evidence of the skills required to access marks in the higher bands of the assessment criteria.

The suggested ranges in these descriptors will not apply equally to all brass and woodwind instruments. They show an increasing requirement from less difficult to more difficult which should be considered as part of the holistic, best fit judgement made. More information about the ranges expected at each Grade can be found in the ABRSM syllabus, available online. Other exam boards may publish similar guidance for their graded practical exams.

# <span id="page-33-0"></span>Table of adjustments for level of difficulty of pieces

The GCSE music performing standard is broadly equivalent to Grade 3 in the graded music examinations. The total raw mark for **each** piece must be adjusted according to the difficulty of the piece, as noted in the table below.

| Raw mark<br>for piece | Level of difficulty     |                |                                 |

# Timing Penalties

The total time of the performances should also be calculated in minutes and seconds, and the following table used to determine the adjusted mark for performing, if the total time is less than 4 minutes. For example, a performance of 3 minutes and 50 seconds initially awarded a mark of 60 is given an adjusted mark of 56 because its duration falls within the 3:45 to 3:59 band. There is no penalty for a submission which is over 6 minutes long.
