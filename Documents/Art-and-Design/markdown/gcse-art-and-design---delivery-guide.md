There is no set time limit for the completion of the portfolio. It is recommended that portfolio work should begin during the spring or summer term in the first year of study The portfolio spring term of the final year of study. Candidates work should be stored securely after submission and during the marking, moderation and review periods.

The purpose of this unit is to undertake contextual and practical research and supporting studies during a preparatory period. This will inform the learner's response during a 10-hour periodofsustainedfocus.

The Externally Set Assignment contains five overarching big ideas. Learners must choose one big idea only and use any of the stimuli from the big idea as a starting point to inform their work.

Learnerswillberequiredtoproducearesponse:

In this unit, learners will apply the knowledge, understanding and skills developed during Unit 1 in response to the big ideas set by WJEC.

## Specification and Assessment Pack

When we develop new qualifications, we produce the following documents:

- Specification- this covers all the information and skills that learners are expected to knowbytheendof theircourse.
- Assessment Pack-this contains the Sample Assessment Materials(SAMs) i.e.: sample exam papers and sample NEA tasks, relevant controls for the NEA and, mark schemes

This guide builds upon the information in the specification and assessment pack to help further your understanding of said documents.

## Understanding the specification amplification

Learnersshouldbemadeawareof:

- thespecificationstems
- what the specification stems mean.

## SpecificationStems

When you look through the specification you will notice in the amplification column, we use a variety of wording before the list of content learners need to know; we call this a stem:

Each stem is used for a slightly different reason:

| Specification Stem                  | When it is used                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| Learners should be aware of         | When learners should expand knowledge of the specified content through a range of contexts. Teachers should refer to Guidance for Teaching documents for further guidance on the depth and breadth to which this content should be taught. |

Perceptive and sophisticated use of media, materials, techniques and processes that are skilfully controlled and imaginatively exploited. Perceptive and discriminating ongoing review and evaluation consistently informs the refinement and development of work as it progresses. | Sophisticated recording of ideas, observations and insights through extensive, coherent research and enquiry that is highly relevant to personal intentions. Perceptive, rigorous and effective critical reflection as work progresses, demonstrating depth of understanding and meaning. | Highly imaginative, personal and meaningful response which realises intentions in a sophisticated, coherent and assured manner.

|     | Effective and thorough development of ideas through sustained and focused investigations. Confident and rigorous critical analysis of sources, providing the basis for purposeful, independent responses. | Ideas are refined and explored through relevant selection and creative experimentation. Effective use of media, materials, techniques and processes are that confidently controlled and exploited. Effective and thorough ongoing review and evaluation informs the refinement and development of work as it progresses. | Confident recording of ideas, observations and insights by appropriate means through effective research and enquiry that is relevant to personal intentions. Rigorous and effective critical reflection as work progresses, demonstrating a good level of understanding and meaning. | Imaginative, personal and meaningful response which realises intentions in a confident and effective manner.
