1,2,have decided,Qualifications Wales **have decided** that these qualifications will be introduced in a phased way; WJEC is now developing the qualifications that are to be available for first teaching from September 2025 to meet these requirements.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"'Qualifications Wales' is a singular entity (an organisation), and therefore requires the singular verb 'has decided' for subject-verb agreement."
2,3,nonexamination,This was particularly prevalent in qualifications where the **nonexamination** assessment is either new or significantly increased.,ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,95,The compound word 'non-examination' requires a hyphen in British English.
3,3,wellbeing,"A notable area of concern in consultation responses and discussions with stakeholder groups links to learners undertaking non-examination assessment across a number of subjects, and the potential negative impact this could have on learner **wellbeing**.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,85,"The term 'well-being' is hyphenated elsewhere in the document (page 4), so it should be consistent for clarity and adherence to common British English usage."
4,4,nonexamination,"Some stakeholders felt that **nonexamination** assessment can further disadvantage some learners, for example, those who do not have support or access to adequate resources at home.",ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,95,The compound word 'non-examination' requires a hyphen in British English.
5,4,maximalise,"However, one stakeholder group had a different view on what impacted equity, requesting that the GCSEs have a range of assessment methods, focusing on competency-based continuous assessment methods, rather than coursework or mini-tests, to **maximalise** equity.",ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,95,'Maximalise' is not a standard British English word; 'maximise' is the correct term.
6,4,Qualification Wales,"When we submit our qualifications to **Qualification Wales** for approval, we must stipulate how we have managed the balance of manageability, engagement, reliability and validity.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,95,"The official name 'Qualifications Wales' is used consistently throughout the document, except for this instance, indicating an inconsistency."
7,5,first first place,"While some positive comments were made around digital submission where learner work has been produced digitally, respondents expressed a concern linked to teacher workload and centre manageability where the infrastructure isn't available to schools to enable the work to be produced digitally by learners in the **first first place**.",ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,98,The repetition of 'first' is a typographical error; it should be 'first place'.
8,5,nonexamination,"Where this is the case, scanning and uploading of **nonexamination** assessment could be time-consuming, particularly when considering the scale of non-examination assessment across the suite of qualifications.",ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,95,The compound word 'non-examination' requires a hyphen in British English.
9,5,re-sits,"A number of Further Education providers raised concerns around **re-sits**, with particular concerns relating to Mathematics and Numeracy, and English Language and Literature.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,"'Resits' is generally preferred as a single word in British English, especially in an educational context, over the hyphenated 're-sits'."
10,6,does not refer,"However, we have reviewed our use of concepts across the outlines and in some cases, where the word does not add value or the Approval Criteria **does not refer** to concepts, we have removed the references.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The noun 'Criteria' is plural, so the verb should be 'do not refer' to maintain subject-verb agreement."
11,7,on or volume of work,"A couple of respondents proposed setting limits on the time spent **on or volume of work** to be submitted for the portfolio; however, after consulting further with stakeholders via our Development Advisory Group, we have decided not to proceed with this but to retain the current flexibility.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,90,The preposition 'on' applies to 'time spent' but not grammatically to 'volume of work'; the phrasing creates an awkward construction. It should be 'on the time spent or the volume of work'.
12,8,marks*.,"The Approval Criteria note that as part of the devising unit, learners must submit a reflective log in a non-prescribed format; this will be compulsory to access the full range of **marks*.**",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The asterisk is an extraneous character and incorrect punctuation at the end of the sentence.
13,8,states that,The Approval Criteria **states that** 30% of the qualification must be assessed by external examination which must include questions on unprepared works.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The noun 'Criteria' is plural, so the verb should be 'state' to maintain subject-verb agreement."
14,8,anytime,stipulating that both the performing and composing units could be assessed **anytime** during the course,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,"In formal British English, 'at any time' or 'any time' (two words) is generally preferred over the single word 'anytime'."
15,9,that the assessment approach is appropriate,"Respondents generally agreed or partially agreed that the proposed assessment approach is appropriate, that the unit purposes are appropriate and engaging for learners and meet the qualification purpose and aims, and **that the assessment approach is appropriate**.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,"The phrase 'that the assessment approach is appropriate' is repeated unnecessarily, making the sentence clunky and redundant."
16,9,stated as,"Some respondents felt that Unit 4 would be more appropriately **stated as** a synoptic unit. Consequently, we have updated the outline to reflect this.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,70,'Stated as' is slightly awkward phrasing; 'described as' or 'more appropriate as' would improve flow.
17,10,around,Some concerns were raised **around** the number of non-examination assessments. We are unable to address this as it reflects a decision made by Qualifications Wales; the Approval Criteria state that there must be two non-examination assessments that account for 40% of the qualification.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,75,'About' is generally preferred over 'around' in formal writing when referring to a topic of concern.
18,10,the Unit 1,"This was not our intention. Consequently, we have changed the title of **the Unit 1** to 'Our physical and human world'.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,90,The definite article 'the' is unnecessary before 'Unit 1' when referring to a specific unit by its number.
19,10,widen out,"Consequently, we have removed the reference to exploring fieldwork in learners' locality, to **widen out** the area that learners can explore. However, it is likely that most fieldwork enquiries will take place in the local area.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,70,'Widen' is more concise and formal than 'widen out' in this context.
20,10,submission we,Following feedback on digital **submission we** will be exploring this further at the next stage of development.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,A comma is required after the introductory participial phrase 'Following feedback on digital submission' to separate it from the main clause.
21,11,study on,"Some respondents expressed that there was excessive emphasis on Welsh history (Unit 1 – An in-depth **study on** Welsh history and Unit 4 – Wales and Britain/the UK) whilst others welcomed the focus, noting that they felt it aligned with the Curriculum for Wales.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,70,'Study of' is generally preferred over 'study on' when referring to the subject matter of a study.
22,11,during the number of,Some respondents expressed concern about the potential amount of content to be covered **during the number of** teaching hours available. Our specification writers are being guided on the number of Guided Learning Hours per unit to ensure that the content is teachable in the time.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,75,'During the number of' is an awkward construction; 'within the available' or 'given the number of' would improve clarity and flow.
23,12,was manageable,Respondents generally agreed or partially agreed that the proposed qualification structure and assessment approach is appropriate and that the proposed qualification **was manageable** for learners.,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,95,The verb tense should be consistent with 'is appropriate' to reflect the current state of the proposed qualification.
24,12,on non-religious,This was not the intention – the qualification will place equal value on religious and **on non-religious** beliefs and philosophical convictions.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The repetition of 'on' is redundant and can be omitted for conciseness and better flow.
25,13,i.e. human rights,"• Relating to the specific units, some respondents felt there were repeated topics **i.e. human rights**, with some respondents questioning why a religious studies qualification was teaching human rights.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,90,"The abbreviation 'i.e.' (that is) is used incorrectly here; 'e.g.' (for example) is more appropriate as 'human rights' is an example of a repeated topic, and it should be followed by a comma."
26,13,"whereas, Unit 4","Unit 3 – Human experience and the world focuses on how environmental issues are approached by people with different religious and/or nonreligious beliefs, **whereas, Unit 4** – Human rights focuses on ethical/moral, human rights issues from religious and non-religious perspectives.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,A comma should not follow the subordinating conjunction 'whereas' when it introduces a clause in this context.
27,13,of the non-examination tasks,"Consequently, we have decided to change the release dates of Unit 2 and 3 **of the non-examination tasks** to May of the first year of study, thus giving learners and teachers more time to prepare.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The phrase 'of the' is redundant here; 'Unit 2 and 3 non-examination tasks' is more concise and natural.
28,14,from reading a variety of text and media,"It will validly secure the requirements of the Approval Criteria that learners must develop their skills **from reading a variety of text and media**, understand and interpret their meaning and message and allow them to further explore ""Cymraeg and me"", whilst building on the skills and knowledge developed as part of the Core Cymraeg qualification.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The preposition 'from' is awkward; 'by reading' is more appropriate to indicate the means of skill development. Additionally, 'text' should be plural 'texts' to agree with 'a variety of'."
29,14,appropriate;,"Respondents generally agreed or partially agreed that the proposed assessment approach is **appropriate; that** the unit purposes are appropriate, engaging for learners and meet the qualification purpose and aims; that the proposed qualification will support the Curriculum for Wales; that the proposed qualification will be manageable for learners and that the text types are appropriate.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,A semicolon is incorrectly used here to separate a main clause from a series of subordinate clauses introduced by 'that'; a comma is the appropriate punctuation.
30,15,represent,Our specification writer for this unit is aware of the concerns and we will aim to include writing that **represent** a variety of perspectives reflecting the diverse nature of Welsh citizenship and its cultures in order to make the unit interesting and relevant to learners.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,"Subject-verb agreement: 'writing' is singular, so the verb should be 'represents'."
31,15,nonexamination,We are unable to address these points as they reflect decisions made by Qualifications Wales; the Approval Criteria states that 50% of the qualification will be assessed through **nonexamination** assessment and marked by the centre.,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"The prefix 'non-' should be hyphenated when preceding a noun in British English for consistency, especially as 'non-examination' appears hyphenated elsewhere in the document."
32,15,states,We are unable to address these points as they reflect decisions made by Qualifications Wales; the Approval Criteria **states** that 50% of the qualification will be assessed through nonexamination assessment and marked by the centre.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,"Subject-verb agreement: 'Criteria' is a plural noun, so the verb should be 'state'."
33,15,nonexamination,"To help support concerns about teacher and learner workload, we have spread the **nonexamination** assessments across the Autumn and Spring terms to aid manageability.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"The prefix 'non-' should be hyphenated when preceding a noun in British English for consistency, especially as 'non-examination' appears hyphenated elsewhere in the document."
34,16,set text,"In response, we are exploring opportunities to add **set text** to Unit 2 and Unit 4. This would help ensure the study of a range of literature whilst promoting flexibility and choice for centres in terms of topics, themes, and diversity.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"Given the aim to 'ensure the study of a range of literature', 'set texts' (plural) is required to refer to multiple literary works."
35,17,nonexamination,Learners will be allowed and encouraged to supplement the anthology texts with their own selections when preparing for the **nonexamination** assessment tasks in Units 3 and 5.,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"The prefix 'non-' should be hyphenated when preceding a noun in British English for consistency, especially as 'non-examination' appears hyphenated earlier on the same page."
36,17,requires,The current GCSE English Literature qualification requires the assessment of poetry in two units: the comparison of two unseen poems in Unit 1 and Unit 3 **requires** the comparison of two poems from fifteen specified poems listed for study.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,"Subject-verb agreement: 'Unit 1 and Unit 3' form a compound subject, so the verb should be 'require'."
37,18,equally split response,We asked stakeholders for their preference for a 4- or 5-unit structure and received an **equally split response**.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The phrasing 'equally split response' is less formal; 'an even split in responses' or 'an equally divided response' would be more appropriate for formal documentation.
38,18,Taking into regard,"**Taking into regard** all comments from the consultation, there was concern that five units may put learners off from opting for a language and that it would appear to be more challenging than other subjects.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,The correct idiom is 'taking into consideration' or 'having regard to'; 'taking into regard' is not standard English.
39,18,around the number,- Some concerns were raised **around the number** of non-examination assessments. We are unable to address these points as they reflect decisions made by Qualifications Wales; the Approval Criteria state that a total of between 45–50% of the qualification must be assessed through non-examination assessment tasks that are set by the awarding body and marked by the awarding body.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,"In formal writing, 'about' or 'concerning' is preferred over 'around' when referring to a topic."
40,18,awarding body,...assessment tasks that are set by the awarding body and marked by the **awarding body**.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,Repetition of 'awarding body' can be avoided for conciseness; 'set and marked by the awarding body' would be more streamlined.
41,18,as reflected in the published Approval Criteria,- Some responses in the consultation referred to non-tiering impacting learner confidence and take up. We are unable to address this point as it reflects a decision on tiering made by Qualifications Wales **as reflected in the published Approval Criteria**.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,Repetition of 'reflected' can be avoided; 'as outlined in the published Approval Criteria' or 'as stated in the published Approval Criteria' would be more varied.
42,18,in terms of clashes,- There was some concern over the timing of Unit 1 non-examination assessment **in terms of clashes** with Welsh oral assessments during the established 5-week oral assessment window.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,'In terms of' is often wordy and can be replaced with more concise phrasing like 'regarding' or 'due to'.
43,18,Higher Tier 45,"However, the current Foundation Tier listening is set at 35 mins with 5 mins additional reading time, and **Higher Tier 45** with 5 mins additional reading time.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,'45' is missing the unit of measurement ('mins' or 'minutes') for parallelism and clarity with the preceding '35 mins'.
44,19,along with exemplars,WJEC will set parameters for text selection **along with exemplars** in each language.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,'Along with' can often be replaced by 'and' or 'as well as' for conciseness in formal writing.
45,19,Qualifications Wales have,"However, **Qualifications Wales have** since removed this requirement from the Approval Criteria and the qualification outline has therefore been revised to include translation from the assessed language into English only.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,"'Qualifications Wales' is a singular entity, so the verb should be 'has' for subject-verb agreement."
46,19,half of the respondents answering,"WJEC received 105 responses, with **half of the respondents answering** on behalf of a school, the majority of those indicating that they were a teacher.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,'Half of the respondents answered' would be more direct and concise.
47,19,clarification whether,Respondents asked for **clarification whether** Unit 1: Financial Mathematics and Other Applications of Numeracy would permit the use of a calculator.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The phrase requires a preposition, such as 'clarification as to whether' or 'clarification on whether'."
48,19,calculator permitted assessment,"We can confirm that this is the case, resulting in the GCSE having an overall split of 70% **calculator permitted assessment**, and 30% non-calculator assessment.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,88,'Calculator-permitted' should be hyphenated as a compound adjective modifying 'assessment'.
49,20,at foundation tier,Some respondents expressed concern that the proposed duration of 1 hour 45 minutes for the examination of Unit 3 is too long **at foundation tier**.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,"For formality and clarity, 'at the Foundation Tier' or 'for the Foundation Tier' would be more appropriate."
50,20,the focus of the units were appropriate,The majority of respondents agreed that **the focus of the units were appropriate** and that they were relevant and engaging for learners.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,"The subject 'focus' is singular, so the verb should be 'was' for subject-verb agreement."
51,20,approach to assessment are appropriate,"Respondents generally agreed or partially agreed that the qualification structure and **approach to assessment are appropriate**, that the proposed qualification will support the Curriculum for Wales and that the proposed qualification was manageable for centres and learners alike.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,"The subject 'approach' is singular, so the verb should be 'is' for subject-verb agreement."
52,20,around the stipulation,"- Some concerns were raised **around the stipulation** of a single programming language. However, this decision was already made by Qualifications Wales; the Approval Criteria state that one programming language was to be chosen by the awarding body.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,"In formal writing, 'about' or 'concerning' is preferred over 'around' when referring to a topic."
53,20,an easy to learn syntax,"Although a few respondents questioned our choice of Python, we chose it as it is widely available, free to use, widely used in industry and **an easy to learn syntax**.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,88,'Easy-to-learn' should be hyphenated as a compound adjective modifying 'syntax'.
54,20,nonexamination assessment,A number of respondents expressed concern regarding the move away from **nonexamination assessment** to a 2-hour digital exam to assess programming.,ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,95,'Non-examination' is a compound adjective and requires a hyphen for correct British English spelling.
55,20,reflected in the Approval Criteria,We are unable to address this as it reflects a decision made by Qualifications Wales and **reflected in the Approval Criteria**.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,Repetition of 'reflected' can be avoided; 'as outlined in the Approval Criteria' or 'as stated in the Approval Criteria' would be more varied.
56,21,have announced,"Some respondents commented that the qualification would not meet the needs of all learners. Qualifications Wales **have announced** that a Single Award GCSE Science qualification will be available for first teaching in 2026, a year after the Double Award qualification is available.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,'Qualifications Wales' is a singular entity and requires the singular verb 'has' for subject-verb agreement.

58,21,"and,","There was some concern about the proposed approach to the assessment timing for Unit 1 – Bringing the Sciences Together **and,** the appropriateness of the focus of the unit.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The comma after 'and' is superfluous and creates an awkward pause; it should be removed.
59,21,sub meetings,"However, WJEC is working with a Development Advisory Group for The Sciences, including **sub meetings** for Biology, Chemistry and Physics, which includes over 20 practicing teachers.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"For consistency with 'sub-reporting' and 'sub-grades' used elsewhere in the document, 'sub-meetings' should be hyphenated."
