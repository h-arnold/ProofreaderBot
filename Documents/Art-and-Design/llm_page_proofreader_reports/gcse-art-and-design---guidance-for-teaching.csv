#### **Unit 1: Portfolio**

Non-examination assessment",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,90,The heading 'Assessment Summary of Assessment' is redundant; 'Summary of Assessment' is sufficient and more appropriate for a formal document heading.
1,7,different sources,"A variety of **different sources** of inspiration should be provided to stimulate and inform learners – these should include both contemporary and historical artefacts, images, documents and references.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,"The word 'different' is redundant when 'variety' is already used, making the phrasing less concise."
2,7,to help inspire new ideas,Looking at work from other contexts outside their own knowledge helps learners to increase knowledge and understanding of art and design **to help inspire new ideas**.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,"The repetition of 'to help' or similar phrasing makes the sentence clunky and could be rephrased for better flow, e.g., 'and inspire new ideas'."
3,7,"within its place in time, society and culture","Learners should be encouraged to understand the significance of a piece of art and design **within its place in time, society and culture**.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,75,"The phrasing 'its place in time' is slightly awkward and could be more concisely expressed, e.g., 'within its historical, societal, and cultural context'."

6,8,In order to,"**In order to** fully understand and respond to 'meaning' in their work, learners are expected to be fully involved in what they are aiming to achieve.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,'In order to' can often be replaced by 'To' for conciseness without loss of meaning.
7,8,i.e:,"While set tasks can be appropriate in the early stages of the GCSE (**i.e:** in the first two terms of Year 10), it is unlikely that an appropriate level of 'meaning' will be found when learners are carrying out teacher directed research and tasks.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The abbreviation 'i.e.' should be followed by a comma, not a colon, in British English."
8,8,teacher directed,...it is unlikely that an appropriate level of 'meaning' will be found when learners are carrying out **teacher directed** research and tasks.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,90,'Teacher-directed' should be hyphenated as a compound adjective modifying 'research and tasks'.

10,9,stages this,In the early **stages this** should be supported by teacher input.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,90,A comma is needed after the introductory adverbial phrase 'In the early stages'.
11,9,skill building phase,"Learners could also be encouraged to review each other's work, ensuring that such experiences remain a positive experience, during the **skill building phase**",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The compound adjective 'skill-building' should be hyphenated when preceding a noun for clarity.
12,10,"research, using","Learners should be able to: <ul><li>develop and **research, using** explorative and analytical skills to support sustained investigative curiosity.</li></ul>",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,90,The comma after 'research' is unnecessary and incorrectly separates the verb from its modifying phrase.
13,10,learner's choice,Teachers should be open to **learner's choice** of direction whilst providing guidance on the appropriateness of suggested artists and designers.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The plural possessive 'learners'' is required as it refers to the choices of multiple learners.
14,10,Primary sources,It is important that **Primary sources** are sought wherever possible – an interview or logged conversation with a gallery or contemporary artist may well be of more value to the learner than a list of biographical notes of someone unavailable.,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,80,'Primary sources' is a common noun and should not be capitalised unless it is part of a proper noun or specific title.
15,11,try out using,"While it is clear that schools will not have access to every technique available, learners should be encouraged to **try out using** new materials and styles within the parameters that the school can offer.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The phrasing 'try out using' is redundant; 'try out new materials' or 'experiment with new materials' would be more concise and natural.
16,11,learner's portfolio,"While it is vital that learners are open to a variety of workshop experiences and demonstrations in the early part of the GCSE course, there is no advantage to demonstrating many different techniques within the **learner's portfolio** unless the investigations have purpose and are evident in developing an outcome.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The plural possessive 'learners'' is required as it refers to the portfolios of multiple learners.

- painting on canvas
- relief or intaglio printmaking",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,"The parenthetical phrase is informal; a more formal phrasing like 'such as, but not limited to, the following' or 'such as the following (this list is not exhaustive)' would be more appropriate for a formal document."
18,13,their,"Where this development and refinement is introduced by the teacher, while initial skill gathering may be taught to the whole cohort, in order to successfully respond to Assessment Objective 2 through experimentation, each learner should be encouraged to take **their** initial learning and develop it in a way that grows into and supports their own personal project.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,90,"'Each learner' is singular, requiring a singular pronoun ('his or her') for formal agreement, or the sentence should be rephrased to use a plural subject."

21,15,Colossal article,"Opportunities to take advantage of this may not be immediately obvious to the learner, so teachers should support learners to reflect on the possibilities that could be considered, for example: <ul><li>figure drawing</li><li>drawing from a musical source</li><li>machine drawing **Colossal article**</li><li>digital drawing</li><li>working drawings</li><li>found drawings</li></ul>",ErrorCategory.AMBIGUOUS_PHRASING,80,"The phrase 'Colossal article' is unclear in the context of a list of drawing types, suggesting a possible OCR error or misplaced reference."
22,15,are stronger,This does not only apply to those who are technically strong; all work where the learners' personal interests are clear **are stronger** than where teachers have led learners down a guided path.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The singular subject 'work' requires the singular verb 'is', not 'are'."
23,15,In order to support,"**In order to support** learners to fulfil this imaginative and intuitive response, it is likely that the learner will need to make the decisions on their work because they feel enabled to be impassioned, interested and invested in what they are doing.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,75,'To support' is more concise and equally clear in formal writing.
24,15,in order to help stimulate,Many learners have interests outside of the classroom into which they can be immersed for their Unit 1 work and it might be in the skill of the teacher to 'know their learners' **in order to help stimulate** an appropriate starting point.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,75,'To help stimulate' is more concise and equally clear in formal writing.
25,16,intent and demonstrate,"• use creative thinking when using tools, materials, and techniques to create, refine and realise outcomes which exhibit clear purpose and **intent and demonstrate** understanding of visual language.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,70,A comma before 'and demonstrate' would improve readability by separating the two main verbs in the compound predicate.

27,16,to the learner,Annotation of work in progress can help to clarify progress **to the learner** as they reflect on their work and can aid the assessing teacher and moderator in the learners' intention.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,'For the learner' is a more idiomatic and clearer preposition in this context.
28,16,in the learners' intention,Annotation of work in progress can help to clarify progress to the learner as they reflect on their work and can aid the assessing teacher and moderator **in the learners' intention**.,ErrorCategory.AMBIGUOUS_PHRASING,85,The phrasing 'in the learners' intention' is awkward and unclear; it should likely be 'in understanding the learners' intention' or 'regarding the learners' intention'.
29,16,exploration and experimental phase,"Links should be clearly made between the initial context, the **exploration and experimental phase**, the reflection of these intentions and the fulfilment of a meaningful response.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,70,'Exploratory and experimental phase' or 'exploration and experimentation phase' would be clearer and more grammatically parallel.

33,17,what in this is relevant,- where was the artist or designer working and **what in this is relevant**,ErrorCategory.AMBIGUOUS_PHRASING,80,The phrasing 'what in this' is vague; 'what in this context is relevant' or 'what about this is relevant' would be clearer.

36,17,in order to reflect,"As investigations unfold and learners' own work develops, the application of critical thinking **in order to reflect** and develop insight is highly valuable in AO3.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,75,'To reflect' is more concise and equally clear in formal writing.
37,18,in a holistic nature,Each Assessment Objective should be clearly met and evidence shown – albeit **in a holistic nature** across the work as a whole,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The phrase 'in a holistic nature' is awkward; 'holistically' would be more concise and natural.

46,21,to their work,"By embedding this approach in learning in the first phase of Year 10, learners will be able to integrate reflection **to their work** when they begin Unit 1.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,'Integrate into' is the more idiomatic and natural phrasing when referring to incorporating something into something else.
47,21,challenging however approached carefully,"Peer review during the skill building phase, can be seen as **challenging however approached carefully**, can be highly influential.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"This sentence requires proper punctuation (e.g., a semicolon before 'however' or a conjunction) to correctly join the clauses."
