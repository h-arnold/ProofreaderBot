0,2,1,| Introduction                                                     | **1**    |,ErrorCategory.FACTUAL_INACCURACY,100,"The table of contents states 'Introduction' is on page 1, but the provided document content for page 1 is an image, and page 0 is the title page, indicating an incorrect page reference."
1,7,different,"A variety of **different** sources of inspiration should be provided to stimulate and inform learners – these should include both contemporary and historical artefacts, images, documents and references.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The word 'different' is redundant as 'variety' already implies difference.
2,7,to help inspire,Looking at work from other contexts outside their own knowledge helps learners to increase knowledge and understanding of art and design **to help inspire** new ideas.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The phrasing 'to help inspire' is slightly clunky; 'and inspire' or 'to inspire' would be more concise and natural.
3,7,encouraging this to be celebrated,It is important to note that learners will come from a variety of cultural backgrounds and **encouraging this to be celebrated** will support an independent and individual approach to their work.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The phrasing is slightly awkward; 'encouraging its celebration' or 'encouraging that this is celebrated' would be more natural.
4,8,"'expressive, having a purpose, worthwhile'","It is likely to be **'expressive, having a purpose, worthwhile'**. This idea of 'meaning' can be amplified to learners through discussion while reviewing other art or design works in the classroom, galleries, studios or workshops.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The use of single quotation marks around a list of adjectives without attribution is stylistically awkward and misleading; they should either be removed or the source attributed.
5,8,In order to,"**In order to** fully understand and respond to 'meaning' in their work, learners are expected to be fully involved in what they are aiming to achieve.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,80,"'In order to' is often wordy and 'To' is sufficient, aligning with the document's general preference for 'to' elsewhere."
6,8,i.e:,"While set tasks can be appropriate in the early stages of the GCSE (**i.e:** in the first two terms of Year 10), it is unlikely that an appropriate level of 'meaning' will be found when learners are carrying out teacher directed research and tasks.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"'i.e.' (id est) should be followed by a comma, not a colon, in British English."
7,8,teacher directed,...when learners are carrying out **teacher directed** research and tasks.,ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,90,'Teacher-directed' should be hyphenated as a compound adjective modifying 'research and tasks'.
8,9,others work,• how to critically analyse and reflect on their own and **others work**.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,The possessive form 'others'' is required here to indicate ownership of 'work'.
9,9,"experience, during","Learners could also be encouraged to review each other's work, ensuring that such experiences remain a positive **experience, during** the skill building phase",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The comma incorrectly separates the noun 'experience' from the restrictive prepositional phrase 'during the skill building phase'.
10,9,skill building phase,"Learners could also be encouraged to review each other's work, ensuring that such experiences remain a positive experience, during the **skill building phase**",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,"As a compound adjective modifying 'phase', 'skill-building' should typically be hyphenated in British English for clarity."
11,9,art and design,This ability to analyse **art and design** work will build the foundations for critical review outlined in 1.2.6 below.,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"The subject name 'Art and Design' is capitalised elsewhere in the document, and consistency should be maintained."
12,10,learner’s choice,Teachers should be open to **learner’s choice** of direction whilst providing guidance on the appropriateness of suggested artists and designers.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,"Given the plural context of 'learners should be supported', the possessive should be plural: 'learners' choice'."
13,10,Primary sources,It is important that **Primary sources** are sought wherever possible – an interview or logged conversation with a gallery or contemporary artist may well be of more value to the learner than a list of biographical notes of someone unavailable.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,'Primary' is an adjective here and should not be capitalised unless it is part of a proper noun or specific named concept.
14,10,the internet,"Equally, seeing work in real life is irreplaceable, despite the breadth of available artists and designers through **the internet**.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,80,"In formal British English, 'Internet' is often capitalised as a proper noun. Consistency should be maintained throughout the document."
15,11,try out using,"While it is clear that schools will not have access to every technique available, learners should be encouraged to **try out using** new materials and styles within the parameters that the school can offer.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The phrasing 'try out using' is redundant; 'try out new materials' or 'experiment with new materials' would be more concise.
16,11,evident in developing an outcome,...unless the investigations have purpose and are **evident in developing an outcome**.,ErrorCategory.AMBIGUOUS_PHRASING,90,The phrase 'evident in developing an outcome' is grammatically awkward and unclear; it is ambiguous whether it means 'visible during the development' or 'clearly contribute to the development'.
17,12,(this list is not limited to the following),This may include specialisms such as **(this list is not limited to the following)**:,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The parenthetical phrase is a complete sentence and is awkwardly phrased for a formal document; a more concise and standard phrasing would be '(but not limited to the following)'.
18,13,don't,"Teachers **don't** have to possess the skills to demonstrate all possible techniques, but instead can encourage learners to research and investigate for themselves – there are many, many, practical tutorials online covering a vast array of techniques for each Pathway.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,Contractions like 'don't' are generally considered less formal and should be avoided in official guidance documents; 'do not' would be more appropriate.
19,15,are stronger,This does not only apply to those who are technically strong; all work where the learners' personal interests are clear **are stronger** than where teachers have led learners down a guided path.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The subject 'work' is singular, requiring the singular verb 'is' for subject-verb agreement."
20,15,on their work,"In order to support learners to fulfil this imaginative and intuitive response, it is likely that the learner will need to make the decisions **on their work** because they feel enabled to be impassioned, interested and invested in what they are doing.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The phrasing 'make decisions about their work' or 'regarding their work' is more idiomatic and precise in British English.
21,15,in order to help,...it might be in the skill of the teacher to 'know their learners' **in order to help** stimulate an appropriate starting point.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The phrase 'in order to' is often wordy; 'to' is sufficient and more concise.
22,16,which exhibit,"...create, refine and realise outcomes **which exhibit** clear purpose and intent and demonstrate understanding of visual language.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,"'That' is generally preferred for restrictive clauses that define the noun, while 'which' is for non-restrictive clauses. Here, the clause defines the type of outcomes."
23,16,in order to successfully,"In the development of skills using any kind of media within each Pathway, **in order to successfully** refine work to fully respond to AO2, the exploration of techniques through experimenting with different tools, materials and techniques should be directional.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The phrase 'in order to' is often wordy; 'to' is sufficient and more concise.
24,16,should be directional,"...the exploration of techniques through experimenting with different tools, materials and techniques **should be directional**.",ErrorCategory.AMBIGUOUS_PHRASING,85,'Directional' is vague in this context; 'should have a clear direction' or 'should be purposeful' would be clearer.
25,16,progress to the learner,Annotation of work in progress can help to clarify **progress to the learner** as they reflect on their work and can aid the assessing teacher and moderator in the learners' intention.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The correct preposition is 'for' when clarifying something for someone.
26,16,in the learners' intention,...and can aid the assessing teacher and moderator **in the learners' intention**.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The phrasing is ungrammatical; it should be 'in understanding the learners' intention' or 'with the learners' intention'.
27,16,exploration and experimental phase,"Links should be clearly made between the initial context, the **exploration and experimental phase**, the reflection of these intentions and the fulfilment of a meaningful response.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The phrasing is awkward; 'exploratory and experimental phase' or 'exploration and experimentation phase' would be more grammatically parallel and clear.
28,17,developing an understanding of,"As part of the contextual investigation which happens, usually, in the early stages of Unit 1 and Unit 2 **developing an understanding of**:",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,This is a sentence fragment; it lacks a main verb for the subject 'As part of the contextual investigation'.
29,17,what in this is relevant,- where was the artist or designer working and **what in this is relevant**,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The phrasing is informal and slightly awkward; 'what aspects of this are relevant' or 'the relevance of this' would be more formal and precise.
30,17,in order to reflect,...the application of critical thinking **in order to reflect** and develop insight is highly valuable in AO3.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The phrase 'in order to' is often wordy; 'to' is sufficient and more concise.
31,17,"including sources influenced by other people, from different places and different times.","• apply critical thinking to a wide variety of art, craft, and design from diverse contexts, **including sources influenced by other people, from different places and different times.**",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,"The phrasing is wordy and could be more concise; 'including those influenced by various people, places, and times' or 'including diverse historical and contemporary sources' would improve flow."
