0,2,amplification,| Understanding the specification **amplification**                | 7  |,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,75,"The term 'amplification' is unusual in this context; 'elaboration', 'details', or 'guidance' would be clearer and more common in educational specifications."
1,3,in better understanding,"It will offer an introduction to the specification, an assessment overview, and will support teachers **in better understanding** how to prepare their learners for the assessment of the different units.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The phrasing 'in better understanding' is awkward; it would be clearer as 'in gaining a better understanding' or 'to better understand'.
2,4,from personal and/or given starting point,"- that is internally set, in consultation with the teacher **from personal and/or given starting point**",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,A definite article 'a' is missing before 'personal and/or given starting point'.
3,4,in order to,Teachers can review learners' work and provide oral and written advice at a general level **in order to** secure a functional outcome.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,'In order to' can often be replaced by 'to' for conciseness without loss of meaning.
4,4,and/preparatory,Learners can have access to resources **and/preparatory** notes.,ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,98,This appears to be an OCR error; it should be 'and/or preparatory notes'.
5,4,study The,It is recommended that portfolio work should begin during the spring or summer term in the first year of **study The** portfolio must be completed before Unit 2 (Externally Set Assignment) is released to learners in the spring term of the final year of study.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,This is a run-on sentence; a full stop is missing between 'study' and 'The'.
6,4,Candidates work,"**Candidates work** should be stored securely after submission and during the marking, moderation and review periods.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,'Candidates' requires an apostrophe to indicate possession ('Candidates' work').
7,4,Candidates work,**Candidates work** should not be released until the Review of Marking and Moderation period has expired.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,'Candidates' requires an apostrophe to indicate possession ('Candidates' work').

This is strictly for teachers only, to prepare resources for learners.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,"In formal British English, dates are typically written as '1 December' or '1st December', rather than 'December 1st'."
10,7,and/preparatory,The teacher cannot provide any advice or feedback on learners' work. Learners can have access to resources **and/preparatory** notes produced in Part 1 only.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The conjunction 'and/preparatory' is grammatically incorrect; it should likely be 'and/or preparatory' or simply 'and preparatory'.

14,9,said documents,This guide builds upon the information in the specification and assessment pack to help further your understanding of **said documents**.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,Using 'said' as an adjective (meaning 'previously mentioned') is overly formal and somewhat archaic; 'these documents' or 'the aforementioned documents' would be more natural.

16,9,knowledge and use it to apply,When learners are required to demonstrate their **knowledge and use it to apply** to familiar and unfamiliar contexts.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The phrasing 'use it to apply' is redundant; 'knowledge and apply it' or 'knowledge and use it for application' would be more concise.

24,11,processes are that confidently controlled,"Effective use of media, materials, techniques and **processes are that confidently controlled** and exploited.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The word 'are' is redundant and creates a grammatical error; it should be 'processes that are confidently controlled'.
