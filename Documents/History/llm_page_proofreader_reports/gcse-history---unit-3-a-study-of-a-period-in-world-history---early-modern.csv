[15]**,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"There is an extraneous asterisk after ""century"", which is a formatting error."

**[5]**",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,90,"The mark allocation `[5]` is repeated unnecessarily after the question, as it is already included within the question itself."

6,9,however; the use,Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (**however; the use** of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen).,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"A semicolon is used incorrectly here; 'however' as a conjunctive adverb should be preceded by a semicolon or a full stop when joining two independent clauses, but 'the use of the full mark range...' is not an independent clause in this construction. A comma after 'however' would be appropriate, or restructuring the sentence."
7,9,him/her,"It should be remembered that candidates are writing under examination conditions and credit should be given for what the candidate writes, rather than adopting the approach of penalising **him/her** for any omissions.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,Using gender-neutral language such as 'them' or 'candidates' is generally preferred in modern educational documents for inclusivity and improved flow.
8,9,two parts; the indicative content,For band-marked questions mark schemes are in **two parts; the indicative content** and the assessment grid.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"A colon should be used to introduce a list of items following an independent clause, rather than a semicolon."
9,10,is appropriate,Examiners are reminded of the need to revisit the answer as they apply the mark scheme in order to confirm that the band and the mark allocated **is appropriate** to the response provided.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The compound subject 'the band and the mark allocated' requires a plural verb 'are appropriate'.

11,14,Goa,Coins were often minted in cities such as **Goa** and their value was based on their metal content and weight.,ErrorCategory.FACTUAL_INACCURACY,98,Goa is located in India and was not a known minting city for currency used in the Songhai Empire in West Africa during this period.

14,17,attribution,One comparison and one contrast made with consideration of content and/or **attribution**,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,95,The term 'attributions' (plural) is used consistently in all other bands of the mark scheme; this instance should be plural for consistency.
15,20,Goa,"Following the success at Tondibi, the Moroccan capture of **Goa** and Timbuktu weakened the Empire's ability to govern and caused instability within the empire.",ErrorCategory.FACTUAL_INACCURACY,100,"The historical location relevant to the Songhai Empire is Gao, not Goa, as also stated in Item 3 on the same page."
16,20,empire,"Following the success at Tondibi, the Moroccan capture of Goa and Timbuktu weakened the Empire's ability to govern and caused instability within the **empire**.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,95,"The term 'Empire' is capitalised when referring to the 'Songhai Empire' elsewhere in the document, indicating it should be treated as a proper noun or specific entity throughout."
17,20,"example,they","For **example,they** may argue that economic and environmental factors were responsible for the collapse of the Songhai Empire.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,100,"A space is missing after the comma, creating a run-on word and hindering readability."
18,21,"Empire, they","Candidates may ultimately judge that Tondibi was the main factor that led to the collapse of the Songhai **Empire, they** may argue that other factors were more significant and fatally weakened the Empire before the Moroccan invasion, or they may judge that those factors impaired the Empire badly and the Battle of Tondibi was the final straw.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,100,"This sentence contains a comma splice, incorrectly joining two independent clauses ('...collapse of the Songhai Empire' and 'they may argue...') with only a comma."

21,28,accuracy Undeveloped,"Inconsistent analysis and evaluation of the items linked to the set question, with some **accuracy Undeveloped** comparisons and contrasts made with consideration of content and/or attributions<br>OR<br>•<br>Detailed comparisons or contrasts made with consideration of content and attributions",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The phrase 'with some accuracy Undeveloped comparisons' is a run-on, lacking appropriate punctuation or conjunction between 'accuracy' and 'Undeveloped' to connect the two clauses or ideas correctly."
22,31,"factors. For example,","However, candidates may challenge the view by emphasising other **factors. For example,** Akbar's rule was successful due to his court and administration system.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,A comma splice incorrectly joins two independent clauses; a semicolon or full stop is required before 'For example'.
23,31,"Further,","**Further,** the success of Akbar's rule was due to his military conquests.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,'Furthermore' or 'Moreover' is generally preferred as a conjunctive adverb to introduce an additional point in formal writing.
24,31,and note,"Candidates may argue that the statement is largely correct, **and note** the positive actions he took to foster religious tolerance within the Empire, or they may argue that while religious tolerance was important, his rule was successful because of the reforms he implemented and/or the expansion that he oversaw.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,90,"The conjunction 'and' connects 'may argue' with 'note', but 'note' lacks a clear subject, creating a grammatical error. It should be 'and they note' or 'and to note'."
