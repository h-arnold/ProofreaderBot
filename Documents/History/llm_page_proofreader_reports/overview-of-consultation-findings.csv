0,3,have decided,Qualifications Wales **have decided** that these qualifications will be introduced in a phased way; WJEC is now developing the qualifications that are to be available for first teaching from September 2025 to meet these requirements.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,"'Qualifications Wales' is a singular entity (an organisation), and therefore requires the singular verb 'has decided' for subject-verb agreement."
1,4,nonexamination,This was particularly prevalent in qualifications where the **nonexamination** assessment is either new or significantly increased.,ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,98,The term 'non-examination' is a compound adjective and should be hyphenated in British English.
2,5,nonexamination,"Some stakeholders felt that **nonexamination** assessment can further disadvantage some learners, for example, those who do not have support or access to adequate resources at home.",ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,98,The term 'non-examination' is a compound adjective and should be hyphenated in British English.
3,5,"assess fairly, or","Respondents noted that they felt that appropriate controls should be in place to ensure that all schools **assess fairly, or** there could be a lack of confidence in qualification results which would consequently mean learner attainment would have less value associated with it.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"This is a comma splice, joining two independent clauses with only a comma. A conjunction (e.g., 'or else') or a semicolon is required."
4,5,maximalise,"However, one stakeholder group had a different view on what impacted equity, requesting that the GCSEs have a range of assessment methods, focusing on competency-based continuous assessment methods, rather than coursework or mini-tests, to **maximalise** equity.",ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,95,'Maximalise' is not a standard British English word; the correct term is 'maximise'.
5,5,Qualification Wales,"When we submit our qualifications to **Qualification Wales** for approval, we must stipulate how we have managed the balance of manageability, engagement, reliability and validity.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,95,"The official name is 'Qualifications Wales' (plural), as used consistently elsewhere in the document."
6,6,decision making,"Whilst these are clearly very important considerations, we now propose that we put learner equity at the heart of our design and **decision making** in relation to non-examination assessments.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,"As a compound noun, 'decision-making' is typically hyphenated in British English for clarity and consistency."
7,6,nonexamination,"Where this is the case, scanning and uploading of **nonexamination** assessment could be time-consuming, particularly when considering the scale of non-examination assessment across the suite of qualifications.",ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,98,The term 'non-examination' is a compound adjective and should be hyphenated in British English.
8,6,Spring,We are undertaking further focused work to explore in more detail and will clarify our expectations in the **Spring**.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,90,"Seasons (spring, summer, autumn, winter) are generally not capitalised in British English unless part of a proper noun."
9,9,marks*.,"The Approval Criteria note that as part of the devising unit, learners must submit a reflective log in a non-prescribed format; this will be compulsory to access the full range of **marks*.** Our specification writers are aware of the concerns raised within the consultation and are working to ensure that the reflective log does not impede learners' creativity and enthusiasm within the devising unit.",ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,95,"Extraneous asterisk character at the end of the sentence, likely an OCR artifact or typographical error."
10,9,states,The Approval Criteria **states** that 30% of the qualification must be assessed by external examination which must include questions on unprepared works.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,100,Subject-verb agreement error; 'Criteria' is a plural noun and requires the plural verb 'state'.
11,10,that the assessment approach is appropriate,"The majority of respondents agreed that the proposed qualification will support the Curriculum for Wales. Respondents generally agreed or partially agreed that the proposed assessment approach is appropriate, that the unit purposes are appropriate and engaging for learners and meet the qualification purpose and aims, **and that the assessment approach is appropriate**.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,90,"The phrase 'that the assessment approach is appropriate' is redundant, repeating a similar phrase earlier in the same sentence."
12,11,around,Some concerns were raised **around** the number of non-examination assessments. We are unable to address this as it reflects a decision made by Qualifications Wales; the Approval Criteria state that there must be two non-examination assessments that account for 40% of the qualification.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,"In formal writing, 'about' is generally preferred over 'around' when referring to a topic or subject."
13,11,"As the Approval Criteria state that one of the non-examination assessments must be marked by the centre and moderated by the WJEC, the Decision Making Exercise will now be marked by centres and moderated by WJEC; this non-examination assessment is 15% of the qualification and is therefore smaller than the fieldwork non-examination assessment at 25%.","The Approval Criteria state that one of the non-examination assessments must be marked by the centre and moderated by the WJEC. Consequently, we have now decided that the fieldwork will be set and marked by WJEC. **As the Approval Criteria state that one of the non-examination assessments must be marked by the centre and moderated by the WJEC, the Decision Making Exercise will now be marked by centres and moderated by WJEC; this non-examination assessment is 15% of the qualification and is therefore smaller than the fieldwork non-examination assessment at 25%.**",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,"The sentence is overly long and contains a repetitive clause ('As the Approval Criteria state that one of the non-examination assessments must be marked by the centre and moderated by the WJEC'), which hinders clarity and flow."
14,11,widen out,"Consequently, we have removed the reference to exploring fieldwork in learners' locality, to **widen out** the area that learners can explore. However, it is likely that most fieldwork enquiries will take place in the local area.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The phrasal verb 'widen out' is less formal; 'widen' or 'broaden' would be more appropriate for this document's tone.
15,11,being mindful,"We propose to explore this further in the next stage of development **being mindful** of fairness, the ability to differentiate, coverage and the need for reading time.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The participial phrase 'being mindful' acts as a dangling modifier; it should be linked to the subject 'we' (e.g., 'while being mindful' or 'mindful of')."
16,11,submission we,Following feedback on digital **submission we** will be exploring this further at the next stage of development.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,A comma is required after the introductory participial phrase 'Following feedback on digital submission'.
17,12,states learners,"We have retained the focus of Unit 1 on specifically Welsh history, in line with the Approval Criteria, which **states learners** must be given an opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge and understanding of Welsh history, along with Wales and the Welsh perspective.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"A conjunction, typically 'that', is missing after 'states' to introduce the subordinate clause."
18,12,and simplified,"We have revisited Unit 4 as a result, **and simplified** and shortened the non-examination assessment. The revised version of the non-examination assessment allows centres to devise a title or titles within set parameters, ensuring that the breadth of the period studied is covered in a more manageable way.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The sentence lacks parallel structure. It should be 'We have revisited Unit 4 as a result, and *we have* simplified and shortened...' or 'We have revisited Unit 4 as a result, *simplifying* and shortening...'"
19,13,was manageable,Respondents generally agreed or partially agreed that the proposed qualification structure and assessment approach is appropriate and that the proposed qualification **was manageable** for learners.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The verb tense 'was manageable' is inconsistent with 'is appropriate' in the same sentence, which should both be in the present tense for consistency."
20,14,i.e. human rights,"• Relating to the specific units, some respondents felt there were repeated topics **i.e. human rights**, with some respondents questioning why a religious studies qualification was teaching human rights.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The abbreviation 'i.e.' (id est) should be followed by a comma in British English.
21,14,nonreligious,"Unit 3 – Human experience and the world focuses on how environmental issues are approached by people with different religious and/or **nonreligious** beliefs, whereas, Unit 4 – Human rights focuses on ethical/moral, human rights issues from religious and non-religious perspectives.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"The term 'nonreligious' is used without a hyphen here, but 'non-religious' is used elsewhere in the document (e.g., page 13), indicating an inconsistency in hyphenation."
22,15,"develop their skills from reading a variety of text and media, understand and interpret their meaning and message and allow them to further explore","It will validly secure the requirements of the Approval Criteria that learners must **develop their skills from reading a variety of text and media, understand and interpret their meaning and message and allow them to further explore** ""Cymraeg and me"", whilst building on the skills and knowledge developed as part of the Core Cymraeg qualification.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,90,"The sentence lacks parallel structure for the verbs following 'must'. 'Develop their skills from reading' is not parallel with 'understand and interpret' and 'allow them to further explore'. It should be rephrased for clarity and grammatical correctness, for example, 'develop their skills by reading..., understand and interpret..., and allow them to further explore...'."
23,16,represent,Our specification writer for this unit is aware of the concerns and we will aim to include writing that **represent** a variety of perspectives reflecting the diverse nature of Welsh citizenship and its cultures in order to make the unit interesting and relevant to learners.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The singular subject 'writing' requires the singular verb 'represents' for subject-verb agreement.
24,16,state,"We are unable to address these points as they reflect decisions made by Qualifications Wales; the Approval Criteria **state** that this is a linear qualification, and that assessment must take place in the final year of the course.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The singular entity 'Approval Criteria' (referring to the document or set of criteria) requires the singular verb 'states'.
25,17,set text,"In response, we are exploring opportunities to add **set text** to Unit 2 and Unit 4. This would help ensure the study of a range of literature whilst promoting flexibility and choice for centres in terms of topics, themes, and diversity.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,90,"Given the context of 'a variety of literary works' and 'a range of literature', 'set texts' (plural) is more appropriate than 'set text' (singular)."
26,17,Single and Double award,"Some respondents were not in agreement with the combined Language and Literature approach, the organisation into **Single and Double award**, or the reduction to two assessment objectives.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"For consistency with 'assessment objectives' and the general reference to categories of awards, 'Single and Double Awards' (plural) is expected."
27,18,double award unit,Assessments based on poetry feature once in the common units and once in a discrete **double award unit**.,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"For consistency with the capitalisation of 'Single Award' and 'Double Award Unit 5' elsewhere in the document, 'Double Award unit' should be capitalised."
28,18,Unit 1 and Unit 3 requires,The current GCSE English Literature qualification requires the assessment of poetry in two units: the comparison of two unseen poems in **Unit 1 and Unit 3 requires** the comparison of two poems from fifteen specified poems listed for study.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The sentence structure is a run-on, attempting to list two distinct requirements after a colon without proper conjunction or punctuation, leading to ambiguity and a potential subject-verb agreement error if 'Unit 1 and Unit 3' is interpreted as a compound subject for 'requires'."
29,18,including one poem,"There will now be one oracy task based on poetry, **including one poem** from the period 1600-1900, and one extended writing task based on the centre's choice of a play by Shakespeare.",ErrorCategory.AMBIGUOUS_PHRASING,85,"The phrase 'including one poem' is a dangling modifier; it is unclear what it is intended to modify, leading to ambiguity."
30,19,being,"WJEC received 90 responses, with over half of those **being** from practitioners within a school.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The use of 'being' is often superfluous and can be omitted for conciseness in formal writing.
31,19,list of grammar,"Some respondents noted that they were pleased to see relevant broad themes, inclusion of cultural and societal awareness in the countries of the assessed languages, the use of high frequency and high utility grammar and core vocabulary, an extensive and comprehensive **list of grammar** and a more skills-centred approach.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,'List of grammar' is an awkward phrasing; 'list of grammatical points' or 'grammar topics' would be more precise.
32,19,Taking into regard,"**Taking into regard** all comments from the consultation, there was concern that five units may put learners off from opting for a language and that it would appear to be more challenging than other subjects.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,The correct idiom is 'taking into consideration' or 'having regard to'; 'taking into regard' is grammatically incorrect.
33,19,awarding body,We are unable to address these points as they reflect decisions made by Qualifications Wales; the Approval Criteria state that a total of between 45–50% of the qualification must be assessed through non-examination assessment tasks that are set by the **awarding body** and marked by the **awarding body**.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,Repetition of 'awarding body' can be avoided for better flow; 'and marked by them' or 'and marked accordingly' would be more concise.
34,19,take up,Some responses in the consultation referred to non-tiering impacting learner confidence and **take up**.,ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,95,"As a noun meaning 'adoption' or 'acceptance,' 'take-up' should be hyphenated in British English (OED)."
35,19,as reflected,We are unable to address this point as it reflects a decision on tiering made by Qualifications Wales **as reflected** in the published Approval Criteria.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The phrase 'as reflected in the published Approval Criteria' is redundant given the preceding 'it reflects a decision... made by Qualifications Wales.'
36,19,sub-sub themes,"There was some concern regarding the number of themes (the current spec has 3 broad themes, 8 sub-themes and 18 **sub-sub themes**). In the revised qualification outline, we have the same three themes and have reduced the proposed number of sub-themes to 8; there are no **sub-sub themes**.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,'Sub-sub themes' is somewhat informal and inconsistent with standard compound noun hyphenation; 'sub-sub-themes' or 'sub-subthemes' would be more formal.
37,19,mins,"However, the current Foundation Tier listening is set at 35 **mins** with 5 **mins** additional reading time, and Higher Tier **45** with 5 **mins** additional reading time.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,'Mins' should be written out as 'minutes' for formality and consistency with 'hours' used elsewhere. 'Higher Tier 45' is also missing 'minutes' for clarity.
38,20,have,"However, Qualifications Wales **have** since removed this requirement from the Approval Criteria and the qualification outline has therefore been revised to include translation from the assessed language into English only.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,"'Qualifications Wales' is a singular entity, so the verb should be 'has' (subject-verb agreement)."
39,20,answering,"WJEC received 105 responses, with half of the respondents **answering** on behalf of a school, the majority of those **indicating** that they were a teacher.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,"The phrasing could be more concise; for example, 'half of whom answered' and 'the majority of whom indicated' or 'the majority indicating they were teachers.'"
40,20,calculator permitted assessment,"We can confirm that this is the case, resulting in the GCSE having an overall split of 70% **calculator permitted assessment**, and 30% non-calculator assessment.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,'Calculator permitted' functions as a compound adjective modifying 'assessment' and would typically be hyphenated ('calculator-permitted') for clarity in British English.
41,21,foundation tier,Some respondents expressed concern that the proposed duration of 1 hour 45 minutes for the examination of Unit 3 is too long at **foundation tier**.,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"'Foundation Tier' is capitalised on page 19 ('Foundation Tier listening'), so it should be consistently capitalised here."
42,21,answering,"WJEC received 55 responses, with 45% of respondents **answering** on behalf of a school.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,"The phrasing could be more concise; for example, '45% of whom answered' or '45% answered.'"
43,21,were,The majority of respondents agreed that the focus of the units **were** appropriate and that they were relevant and engaging for learners.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,"The subject 'focus' is singular, so the verb should be 'was' (subject-verb agreement)."
44,21,are,"Respondents generally agreed or partially agreed that the qualification structure and approach to assessment **are** appropriate, that the proposed qualification will support the Curriculum for Wales and that the proposed qualification was manageable for centres and learners alike.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,"The subject 'approach' is singular, so the verb should be 'is' (subject-verb agreement)."
45,21,easy to learn syntax,"Although a few respondents questioned our choice of Python, we chose it as it is widely available, free to use, widely used in industry and an **easy to learn syntax**.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,'Easy to learn' functions as a compound adjective modifying 'syntax' and should be hyphenated ('easy-to-learn syntax') for clarity.
46,21,nonexamination assessment,A number of respondents expressed concern regarding the move away from **nonexamination assessment** to a 2-hour digital exam to assess programming.,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"The term 'non-examination assessment' is hyphenated elsewhere in the document (e.g., page 19), so it should be consistently hyphenated here."
47,21,reflected in the Approval Criteria,We are unable to address this as it reflects a decision made by Qualifications Wales and **reflected in the Approval Criteria**.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The phrase 'and reflected in the Approval Criteria' is somewhat redundant given the preceding 'it reflects a decision made by Qualifications Wales.'
48,22,have announced,"Qualifications Wales **have announced** that a Single Award GCSE Science qualification will be available for first teaching in 2026, a year after the Double Award qualification is available.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,"Qualifications Wales is a singular entity, therefore the verb should be 'has announced' for subject-verb agreement."
49,22,subreporting,The Sciences Double Award will be designed to support progression to science AS and A level qualifications and the **subreporting** will help centres measure attainment of the separate science disciplines.,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"The term 'sub-reporting' was hyphenated earlier in the document ('sub-reporting of grades'), and 'sub-grades' was also hyphenated. For consistency, 'subreporting' should be hyphenated as 'sub-reporting'."
50,22,"and,","There was some concern about the proposed approach to the assessment timing for Unit 1 – Bringing the Sciences Together **and,** the appropriateness of the focus of the unit.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The comma after 'and' is grammatically incorrect as 'and' is joining two noun phrases, not independent clauses, and does not require a comma in this context."
51,22,sub meetings,"However, WJEC is working with a Development Advisory Group for The Sciences, including **sub meetings** for Biology, Chemistry and Physics, which includes over 20 practicing teachers.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"For consistency with 'sub-reporting' and 'sub-grades' used elsewhere in the document, 'sub meetings' should be hyphenated as 'sub-meetings'."
