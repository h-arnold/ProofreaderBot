Do **not** use gel pen or correction fluid.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,"In British English, 'ball-point pen' is commonly hyphenated when used as a compound noun, or 'ballpoint pen' as a single word.

3,7,Tywysogion a,"An anonymous author, writing in the entry for 1176 in *Brut y **Tywysogion** a Welsh translation of a lost Latin text *Chronicle of the Princes of Wales*. It is likely that the translation was made by Welsh monks at the abbey of Strata Florida.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,A comma is required after 'Tywysogion' to correctly introduce the appositive phrase 'a Welsh translation'.

6,11,however;,Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (**however;** the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen).,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,"The semicolon after 'however' is incorrect; it should be a comma, or the sentence should be rephrased."
7,11,him/her,"It should be remembered that candidates are writing under examination conditions and credit should be given for what the candidate writes, rather than adopting the approach of penalising **him/her** for any omissions.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,"Using 'them' or rephrasing for gender neutrality (e.g., 'penalising a candidate') is generally preferred in modern professional writing."
8,12,banded mark questions,The marking of **banded mark questions** should always be positive.,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"The term 'band-marked questions' is used on page 11, indicating an inconsistency in hyphenation for the same compound adjective."
9,17,for example his sons,"However, its value is limited as it is important to understand the reasons for these problems, **for example his sons**, Maelgwn, Rhys Gryg and Maredudd were concerned about the question of succession.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,A comma after 'for example' is generally preferred in formal British English when introducing an explanatory phrase to improve readability.

11,17,or its brevity and relative outdatedness may be argued,"Overall, it could be suggested that the item is valuable in that it provides an expert analysis of the reasons why Rhys ap Gruffudd became involved in warfare between 1189 and 1196, **or its brevity and relative outdatedness may be argued** to be limiting factors that make it less, rather than more valuable to our understanding of this issue.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,"The use of 'or' to introduce a contrasting idea within the same clause, followed by 'may be argued', creates a slightly awkward sentence structure. Rephrasing or starting a new sentence would improve clarity."
12,20,Brut y Tywysogion a Welsh,"Item 3: An anonymous author, writing in the entry for 1176 in Brut y Tywysogion** a Welsh** translation of a lost Latin text Chronicle of the Princes of Wales.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,A comma is needed to separate the title of the work ('Brut y Tywysogion') from the descriptive phrase that follows it.
13,21,Abbey,"However, it will likely be noted that his successes would be stressed in an account written by the monks of an **Abbey** he was patronising.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The word 'Abbey' should be lowercase as it refers to a general institution, not a specific named abbey, in this context."
14,21,to a point,"Overall, the items are persuasive, **to a point**, that Rhys enjoyed some successes at this time, as they indicate the cultural achievements Rhys made.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The phrase 'to a point' is informal; 'to some extent' or 'partially' would be more appropriate for a formal educational document.

16,24,Penal letter,"French and Scottish ships patrolled the coast of Wales attacking English bases and reducing the risk of a large-scale attack from the sea against Glyndwr. The 1406 **Penal letter** saw Glyndwr propose joint action with France against the English which would have helped him to maintain the momentum of his revolt, just as his military campaigns in Wales began to falter.",ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,99,"The correct historical term for the letter sent by Owain Glyndŵr in 1406 is the 'Pennal Letter', not 'Penal letter'."
17,26,unknown some,"Glyndwr's burial place is **unknown some** people think Glyndwr is buried near Corwen where his estates had been, others say he is buried in Herefordshire where his daughters had married local landowners.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,This is a run-on sentence; two independent clauses are joined without proper punctuation. A full stop or semicolon is needed after 'unknown'.

A semicolon or a conjunction with a comma is required."
19,27,that that,"The item is valuable to an understanding of the last years of Owain Glyndwr's revolt as it explains **that that** while the English had recaptured a lot of the territory that had fallen to the Welsh during Glyndwr's revolt, there were still some places that resisted English control.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,Redundant repetition of the word 'that'.

21,29,Mynydd Hydgen,"They met around 500 of them at **Mynydd Hydgen**, twenty miles from Aberystwyth in the Cambrian Mountains.",ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,95,"The place name 'Mynydd Hyddgen' is consistently spelt with 'dd' in the question title on the same page, indicating 'Hydgen' is a misspelling."

'Medieval history' is the standard usage."
23,30,is idea,"However, more persuasive **is idea** that it was actually the successes of Glyndwr's revolt that inspired people to join his rebellion, as a result of victories such as the swift capture of Conwy Castle or military victories such as Mynydd Hyddgen or Bryn Glas.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"A definite article 'the' is missing before 'idea', making the sentence grammatically incorrect."

25,31,persuasive that,"Overall, the items are **persuasive that** Henry IV's policies made a contribution to increased support for Glyndwr's rebellion, as they indicate reasons for the Welsh to be resentful towards the English.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The phrasing 'persuasive that' is awkward; 'persuasive in demonstrating that' or 'persuasive in suggesting that' would be more precise and professional.
26,31,It will likely be concluded,It will likely be concluded that Henry IV's actions did inspire people to join Glyndwr's revolt.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The passive voice makes the sentence slightly wordy; rephrasing to 'It is likely that Henry IV's actions inspired people...' or 'Henry IV's actions likely inspired people...' would be more direct.
27,34,provided to,A form of acknowledgement has been **provided to** all items.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,"The preposition 'to' is less appropriate here; 'for' would more accurately convey that the acknowledgement is made on behalf of or concerning the items, rather than being given directly to them."
