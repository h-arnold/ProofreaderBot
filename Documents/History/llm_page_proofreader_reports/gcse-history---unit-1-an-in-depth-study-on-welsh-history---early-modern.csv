0,4,section A,Answer all questions in **either** **section A** **or** Section B.,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,95,The capitalisation of 'section A' should be consistent with 'Section B' for proper noun usage in this context.
1,4,Welsh history 1: Early Modern,**GCSE History – Unit 1 An in-depth study on Welsh history 1: Early Modern**,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,90,The phrasing 'Welsh history 1: Early Modern' is awkward and unclear; it would be more conventional to use 'Welsh history: Early Modern' or 'Welsh history (Early Modern)' for better readability and clarity.
2,6,Katherine of Aragon,"Sir Rhys ap Gruffudd was critical of Henry's relationship with Anne Boleyn, instead supporting both **Katherine of Aragon** and Cardinal Wolsey.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,95,"While 'Katherine' is a valid spelling, 'Catherine of Aragon' is the overwhelmingly more common and historically accepted spelling for this figure in academic and educational contexts, and consistency with standard historical naming conventions is preferred."
3,9,"England, the Scottish that","The English view was that Scotland should be incorporated into **England, the Scottish that** the two kingdoms should be equal partners. The contemporary historian Sir Robert Cotton argued at the time that, previously, smaller kingdoms had joined to become the kingdom of England, so now the smaller kingdoms within the British Isles would come together under the ancient name of Britain.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,"This is a comma splice, joining two independent clauses without a coordinating conjunction. It should be separated by a semicolon, a full stop, or a conjunction."
4,10,6 000,"We hear that **6 000** Irish rebels have landed in Wales. They are behaving in a cruel and savage way. Unless some speedy help is sent to Chirk, the whole country will be destroyed by these Irish invaders.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,"Standard British English numerical formatting typically uses a comma for thousands (e.g., 6,000) or no separator for four-digit numbers (e.g., 6000) in formal prose."
5,11,however;,Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (**however;** the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen).,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"When 'however' is used as a conjunctive adverb to connect two independent clauses, it should be preceded by a semicolon and followed by a comma. The comma after 'however' is missing."
6,11,him/her,"It should be remembered that candidates are writing under examination conditions and credit should be given for what the candidate writes, rather than adopting the approach of penalising **him/her** for any omissions.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,Using gender-neutral language such as 'them' or rephrasing to 'penalising candidates' is generally preferred in modern formal educational documents for inclusivity and flow.
7,11,parts;,For band-marked questions mark schemes are in two **parts;** the indicative content and the assessment grid.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"A colon should be used to introduce a list that elaborates on the preceding phrase, rather than a semicolon."
8,11,'Credit any other valid response.',The inclusion of **'Credit any other valid response.'** (or similar instruction) within mark schemes allows for the possible variation in candidates' responses.,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,The use of single quotation marks is inconsistent with the standard use of double quotation marks for direct phrases or titles within the document.
9,14,"as,","Henry also had a claim to the throne by marriage **as,** after his defeat of Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485, he married Elizabeth of York, the daughter of Richard III's predecessor Edward IV.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,90,"The comma after 'as' incorrectly separates the conjunction from the adverbial phrase that follows, disrupting the flow of the subordinate clause."
10,16,Marcher lords had,"The Council of the Marches, which had been established in the fifteenth century to help the English monarchy control the **Marcher lords had** not been very effective, which is why Marcher lords like the Herberts had been able to use their distance from London to exercise some independence.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,A comma is missing before 'had not been very effective' to correctly separate the non-restrictive clause 'which had been established...Marcher lords'.
11,16,marcher lords,"One of the problems facing Henry VIII in controlling Wales was that it was divided into two different kinds of territories – those directly under the control of the Crown, and those under control of the **marcher lords** who could raise their own taxes and even their own armies.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"The term 'Marcher lords' is inconsistently capitalised; it should be consistently capitalised as a specific historical group, as it is elsewhere in the document."
12,17,The History of Wales,Item 1: Huw Llywelyn Rees writing on his personal Facebook blog **The History of Wales** (2021),ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,Titles of blogs or publications should typically be italicised or enclosed in quotation marks for clarity and adherence to style guides.
13,17,as what it does not tell us about this is that,"However, its value is limited, **as what it does not tell us about this is that** Sir Rhys had rebelled against Henry VIII's decision to give his grandfather's inheritance to his rival Lord Ferrers",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,"The phrasing is clunky and could be more concise and direct, for example, 'as it does not tell us that' or 'as it omits the fact that'."
14,17,marcher lords,"But this too is undermined by the lack of explanation of Henry VIII's difficulties with a number of the **marcher lords** in Wales and that he was trying various means to increase his influence there, in this case by favouring a supporter in a legal dispute.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"The term 'Marcher lords' is inconsistently capitalised; it should be consistently capitalised as a specific historical group, as it is elsewhere in the document."
15,17,The information this item which is an interpretation includes is potentially accurate,"**The information this item which is an interpretation includes is potentially accurate**, if its author Huw Llywelyn Rees has properly researched the subject.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,90,"The sentence structure is awkward and grammatically incorrect; it should be rephrased for clarity, e.g., 'The information included in this item, which is an interpretation, is potentially accurate.'"
16,17,"Although,","**Although, as** it is from his personal Facebook page there is no information about how he has found this information.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The comma after 'Although' is unnecessary when it introduces a subordinate clause.
17,17,and clearly an interest for him.,It may also be suggested that the interpretation's value is enhanced by the author's clear interest in the history of Wales as it is the title of his Facebook page **and clearly an interest for him.**,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,75,"The phrasing is somewhat informal and could be improved for academic tone, e.g., 'and is clearly an area of interest for him.'"
18,19,King,Henry's adviser Thomas Cromwell had a plan to increase royal power by putting all areas of Wales more directly under the control of the **King**.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"When referring to a specific monarch, 'King' should be capitalised in British English."
19,20,is idea,"However, more persuasive **is idea** that the Acts of Union brought an end to the lawlessness that had plagued areas of Wales under the control of the marcher lords and that more effective justice was available for everyone in Wales.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,A definite article 'the' is missing before 'idea' to complete the grammatical structure.
20,20,Act of Union,"Written by a historian, it may be argued to offer a credible analysis of the impact of the **Act of Union**, with the caveat that as it is from an academic book which covers the history of Wales between 1536 and 1689, it would necessarily offer only an overview of the period.",ErrorCategory.FACTUAL_INACCURACY,95,The document consistently refers to the 'Acts of Union' (plural) as there were two acts (1536 and 1543). Using 'Act of Union' (singular) here is inconsistent and factually imprecise.
21,22,Welsh man,Who was the influential **Welsh man** during the reign of Charles I?,ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,98,'Welshman' is the correct single-word spelling for a man from Wales in British English.
22,23,Lords,"Richard was not well suited to being a leader, so **Lords** and MPs began to plot against him.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"When referring to members of the House of Lords in conjunction with 'MPs', 'Lords' should be capitalised for consistency and formal tone."
23,23,republic,"Oliver Cromwell was succeeded as ruler of the **republic** by his son Richard. The irony was not lost on his opponents – that the man who had so strongly opposed the idea of a return to a monarchy had wanted his son to succeed him. Richard was not well suited to being a leader, so Lords and MPs began to plot against him. Richard Cromwell quickly stood down and returned his powers to Parliament.
- It was not just disagreement over who should run the Republic, as this situation now gave hope to those who had continued to support the monarch, even after the Royalists had been defeated. Support for the Stuart monarchy had continued amongst many of the Welsh gentry and the ordinary people of Wales throughout the period of the Republic. Support for the Stuarts in Wales can be seen by the 1659 declaration, that Charles II was rightful king, by Thomas Myddleton of Chirk, a former supporter of Parliament who had become disillusioned after the execution of the king and harsh rule of Cromwell's Republic.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,95,The term 'Republic' is inconsistently capitalised throughout the text; it should be consistently capitalised as 'the Republic' when referring to the specific historical period of the Commonwealth/Protectorate.
24,25,imposition of the King James Bible,"Puritans were angered by the **imposition of the King James Bible**, a new official version that they did not like, which was to be used in all churches. This was particularly a problem for James in Scotland as the vast majority of Scottish people were members of the Puritan state church.",ErrorCategory.FACTUAL_INACCURACY,100,The King James Bible was generally well-received and not a primary source of Puritan anger; their grievances were more related to church governance and ceremonies.
25,25,had ruling,Religion was one of the problems that James **had ruling** his kingdoms as his attempts to bring the different branches of religion in his different kingdoms alienated extremists on both sides.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The phrasing 'had ruling' is grammatically awkward; 'had in ruling' or 'faced in ruling' would be more idiomatic.
26,26,to an understanding,"The item is valuable **to an understanding** of the reasons why James I had problems ruling his kingdoms as it explains that James wanted to treat both of his kingdoms as if they were the same kingdom, which he wanted to call Britain.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The phrase 'to an understanding' is less idiomatic than 'for understanding' or 'in understanding' in this context.
27,26,is,"However, its value is limited as **is** gives no indication as to what other politicians thought of this issue of how to treat the kingdoms of England and Scotland now they were ruled by the same monarch.",ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,95,The word 'is' is a contextual spelling error and should be 'it' to maintain subject-verb agreement and meaning.
28,26,The information this item which is an interpretation includes is accurate,"**The information this item which is an interpretation includes is accurate**, as would be expected from a History teacher and author who would have done research before writing and publishing this information online.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,"The phrasing is convoluted and could be rephrased for clarity, for example, 'The information included in this item, which is an interpretation, is accurate'."
29,26,to be,"Or, it may be argued **to be** limiting factors, such as it being written for an educational website, that make it less, rather than more, valuable to our understanding of this issue.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The sentence requires 'that' after 'argued' to introduce the clause about limiting factors, for example, 'it may be argued that there are limiting factors' or 'it may be argued that limiting factors exist'."
30,29,6 000,We hear that **6 000** Irish rebels have landed in Wales. They are behaving in a cruel and savage way.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,90,"Numbers in the thousands should typically use a comma as a separator in British English (e.g., '6,000')."
31,29,the king,"From the outset it was vitally important for **the king** to control the borderlands. Wales could not only supply him with wealth, supplies and armies, but might also offer a route for loyal troops from Ireland if he needed them.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,95,"When referring to a specific monarch in a historical context, 'King' should be capitalised for consistency and formality."
32,29,is a modern interpretation would be able,"Item 3, on the other hand, **is a modern interpretation would be able** to offer an overview of the period. Written by a historian, it may be argued to offer a credible analysis of the strategic importance of Wales in the Civil War, with the caveat that as it is from a textbook which covers the history of Wales over nearly 150 years, it would necessarily offer only an overview of Welsh history in this period.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,"The sentence is grammatically incorrect; it requires a relative pronoun or conjunction (e.g., 'that would be able' or 'and would be able') to connect the clauses correctly."
33,33,provided to all items,"A form of acknowledgement has been **provided to all items**. To the best of our knowledge, all items are being used in compliance with the Fair Use Policy; if there are omissions or inaccuracies, please inform us so that any necessary corrections can be made.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,75,The preposition 'to' is less idiomatic here; 'provided for all items' or 'acknowledgement of all items has been provided' would be more natural and clearer in British English.
