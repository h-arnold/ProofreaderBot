0,4,section A,Answer all questions in **either** section A **or** Section B.,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,95,"The capitalisation of 'section A' is inconsistent with 'Section B' in the same sentence and with the repeated instruction on page 5, where both are capitalised."
1,5,c.1914– c.1959,#### 1.6 Wales in the early to mid-twentieth century **c.1914– c.1959**,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The spacing around the en-dash in the date range is inconsistent; it should either be 'c.1914–c.1959' (no spaces) or 'c. 1914 – c. 1959' (spaces around the en-dash) for clarity and consistency.
2,11,however;,Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (**however;** the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen).,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,A semicolon is incorrectly used here; a comma or an em-dash would be more appropriate to introduce a parenthetical clause or a contrasting statement. This is a comma splice if 'however' is used as a conjunctive adverb joining two independent clauses.
3,11,him/her,"It should be remembered that candidates are writing under examination conditions and credit should be given for what the candidate writes, rather than adopting the approach of penalising **him/her** for any omissions.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,Using gender-neutral language such as 'them' or rephrasing to 'the candidate' would be more inclusive and professional in formal documentation.
4,11,parts; the,For band-marked questions mark schemes are in two **parts; the** indicative content and the assessment grid.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,A semicolon is incorrectly used here to introduce a list or explanation; a colon would be the correct punctuation mark.
5,12,banded mark questions,"The marking of **banded mark questions** should always be positive. This means that, for each candidate's response, marks are accumulated for the demonstration of relevant skills, knowledge and understanding: they are not deducted from a maximum on the basis of errors or omissions.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,"For consistency with 'band-marked questions' on page 11, and for clarity as a compound adjective, 'banded-mark questions' or 'banded questions' would be preferable."
6,14,make,"It was these landlords who set the tolls on the roads and who were pressuring farmers of smallholdings to give up their smallholdings so they could **make**, rent or sell larger and more profitable farms.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,"The verb 'make' is imprecise in this context; 'develop', 'create', or 'consolidate' would be more appropriate for describing the formation of larger farms by landlords."
7,17,that that,"But this too is undermined by the lack of explanation about the grievances of the protesters, **that that** their anger was directed at the bailiffs and the Court of Requests who had deprived other members of the community of their property in lieu of their debts, rather than it being directed at the government.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,The repetition of 'that' is a grammatical error; one instance is redundant.
8,17,to be limiting factors,"Or it may be argued **to be limiting factors** like the anonymity of its author or authors writing in the public domain that makes it less, rather than more valuable to our understanding of this issue.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The phrasing 'argued to be limiting factors' is grammatically incorrect in this context; it should likely be 'argued that limiting factors...' or 'argued that factors... are limiting factors'.
9,21,between the Chartists carrying weapons on the left-hand side of the picture to the soldiers firing on them,Item 2 refers to the **violence between the Chartists carrying weapons on the left-hand side of the picture to the soldiers firing on them** on the right-hand side of the picture.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"When describing an interaction or conflict involving two parties, the correct preposition to use with 'between' is 'and', not 'to'."
10,24,would have had done,Workers in the 1950s were being paid higher wages and working fewer hours than they **would have had done** before the Second World War. This gave them more time and more money to spend on leisure activities.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The phrase 'would have had done' is grammatically incorrect and redundant; it should be 'would have done'.
11,27,English,The item is valuable to an understanding of the influence of Welsh nationalism in the 1950s as it explains that the flooding of Capel Celyn to make a reservoir for Liverpool had created a lot of anger at the **English** exploitation of Welsh resources and its lack of care for Welsh-speaking communities.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,"Adjectives derived from proper nouns, such as nationalities, should be capitalised in British English."
12,27,provided,The item also has value in that it states that there was anger about a Welsh-speaking community and natural resources from Wales being sacrificed to **provided** water to a city in England for free.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,99,The infinitive form 'to provide' is required after 'to' in this context.
13,27,the significance of the amount of information,It may also be suggested that the interpretation's value is enhanced by **the significance of the amount of information** that would have been available to David Williamson as the article was being written sixty years after the events being described.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The phrasing is verbose and could be more concise; 'the amount of information' or 'the wealth of information' would be clearer.
14,27,Or it,"Overall, it could be suggested that the item is valuable in that it provides information about the response of the people of Capel Celyn, and their nationalist supporters, to the proposals to destroy a Welsh-speaking community in Wales to provide water for Liverpool. **Or it**",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,99,"The sentence is incomplete and ends abruptly, indicating a missing phrase or an unfinished thought."
15,30,"more persuasive is the idea that it was not just the racial violence of these attacks themselves, but also the police and courts blaming the violence on the black men and their families, making out that the victims were actually guilty of crimes, that was significant about these racial tensions.","However, **more persuasive is the idea that it was not just the racial violence of these attacks themselves, but also the police and courts blaming the violence on the black men and their families, making out that the victims were actually guilty of crimes, that was significant about these racial tensions**. There is also nothing in these items about the causes of these tensions, especially their timing, as men were being demobilised after the First World War.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,"The sentence is grammatically correct but overly long and convoluted, hindering clarity and flow. It could be rephrased for better readability."
16,35,to all items,A form of acknowledgement has been provided **to all items**.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The preposition 'to' is incorrect; 'for' or a rephrasing (e.g., 'All items have been acknowledged') would be grammatically appropriate in this context."
