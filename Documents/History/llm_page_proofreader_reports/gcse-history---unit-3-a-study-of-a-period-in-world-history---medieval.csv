35,32,crusades,"Austin Cline, an author focusing on the study of atheism, writing in the article ""The Military and Political Effects of the<br>Crusades"" on the educational website Learn Religions<br>(2019)<br>One of the things which helped prevent the Crusades from being successful was this constant bickering and infighting. There was, of<br>course, plenty of that among Muslim leaders as well, but in the end, the divisions among European Christians were worse and caused<br>more problems when it came to mounting effective military campaigns in the East.<br>Candidates may respond to the question by offering the following suggestions. This material is not prescriptive and other responses may be acceptable.<br>- The view expressed in Item 3 that the Crusades were unsuccessful because of divisions between rulers has some credibility. There was fighting and power struggles between the leaders, for example Richard the Lionheart and Phillip II during the Third Crusade, that led to poor decision making, a lack of unity and issues with military campaigns. As the crusaders came from various regions with different languages and customs, there was misunderstanding and distrust.<br>- Once established, the crusader states, such as the Kingdom of Jerusalem and Principality of Antioch, operated independently.

38,32,Crusaders,"Furthermore, the crusaders were unsuccessful as the crusader kingdoms were too difficult to maintain. The distance from Europe to the Holy Land made it difficult to maintain reinforcements and supplies. The **Crusaders** relied on fortifications and military force to keep control, which alienated potential allies. The loss of Jerusalem in 1187 to Saladin showed the vulnerability of the Crusader kingdoms and attempts to impose Christianity and European culture led to tensions with local populations and difficulties maintaining control.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,95,"The term 'crusaders' (referring to the people) is generally lowercase elsewhere in the document (e.g., 'remaining crusaders', 'crusaders' defeat').
