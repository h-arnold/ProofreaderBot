1,5,Aethelred's,"This marriage had been arranged as part of **Aethelred's** attempts to improve English relations with Normandy. But Æthelred had sons from his first marriage, and when he died in 1016, he did so in the midst of a battle for the throne between his eldest surviving son, Edmund Ironside, and Cnut the Great of Denmark.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,95,The name 'Æthelred' is consistently spelled with an 'Æ' elsewhere in the document; 'Aethelred's' is an inconsistent capitalisation.
2,5,Edmund though died,"Edmund Ironside, and Cnut the Great of Denmark. **Edmund though died** shortly afterwards, and at his death, Cnut succeeded to the kingdom of England.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,"The phrasing 'Edmund though died' is awkward; it would be more natural as 'Edmund, though, died' or 'Edmund died, though, shortly afterwards'."

He sent Harold over to Duke William to repeat the promise … Harold swore an oath to be loyal and obedient to William.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,"The use of an ellipsis in this context, which appears to be a summary or paraphrase rather than a direct, truncated quote, is stylistically inappropriate and can be confusing."
4,5,… Harold swore an oath,He sent Harold over to Duke William to repeat the promise **… Harold swore an oath** to be loyal and obedient to William. This solemn promise was made in the usual sacred Christian way.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,"The use of an ellipsis in this context, which appears to be a summary or paraphrase rather than a direct, truncated quote, is stylistically inappropriate and can be confusing."
5,6,the channel,"Probably in that year he set out to cross **the channel**. The reasons for this journey are not known for certain, but most historians have assumed that he was sent by Edward to confirm William's succession, and that he had, by this time, accepted it as inevitable.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,95,"When referring to the English Channel, 'Channel' should be capitalised as it is a proper noun."
6,6,Count Guy,"If this is so, he arrived in Normandy by a circuitous route since, apparently because of adverse weather, he landed in Ponthieu, was captured by **Count Guy**, and then ransomed.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,Titles such as 'Count' should be capitalised when used directly before a proper name.
7,6,papal court,"William's version was more widely accepted, partly because he was represented at the **papal court** and Harold was not.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,'Papal court' refers to a specific institution associated with the Pope and should be capitalised for consistency and formality.
8,6,king of Norway,"On 20 September 1066 a great army led by Harald Hardrada, **king of Norway**, and Tostig, the deposed Earl of Northumbria and Harold's own brother, defeated an English army near York and took the city.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,Titles such as 'King' should be capitalised when used as a specific title with a name or country.

11,6,in the South,"Harold therefore marched north, although he knew very well that William was only awaiting a favourable opportunity to invade **in the South**.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"When referring to a specific region of a country, 'South' should be capitalised."
12,7,Baron,The more land the **Baron** was given the more knights he had to provide.,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"Inconsistent capitalisation of a common noun; 'barons' was used earlier in lowercase, which is the standard for a general term."
13,8,decentralization,...essentially a result of the **decentralization** of the power in the Empires.,ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,95,"British English spelling typically uses '-sation' for this word, i.e., 'decentralisation'."
14,8,land holdings,"It began when mounted soldiers started establishing **land holdings** of their own, essentially a result of the decentralisation of the power in the Empires. This led to vast land holdings in the hands of these soldiers who eventually became the nobility, and the land was further subdivided into smaller **land holdings** which were called 'fiefs'.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,The term 'landholdings' is typically written as one word as a compound noun in British English. Consistent usage as one word is preferred.
15,8,as were present,"Since previous social structures **as were present** during the Roman era had crumbled in Western Europe, feudalism emerged as a viable alternative for the new social circumstances.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The phrasing 'as were present' is slightly awkward; 'such as were present' or 'that were present' would improve flow and clarity.
16,8,feudal set-up,"In the **feudal set-up**, peasants were given land holdings that they could cultivate and live on in return for the provided labour to landowners.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,"'Feudal set-up' is informal compared to 'feudal system' or 'feudal structure,' which are used elsewhere in the document and are more appropriate for formal historical writing."
17,8,provided labour,...in return for the **provided labour** to landowners.,ErrorCategory.AMBIGUOUS_PHRASING,85,The phrasing 'provided labour' is ambiguous; it could mean labour that was supplied or labour that was already given. 'labour provided to landowners' or 'labour they provided to landowners' would be clearer.
18,9,fought on desperate,"...and **fought on desperate**, till there were none left to fight.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,An adverb is required here to modify the verb 'fought'; 'desperately' should be used instead of the adjective 'desperate'.

20,9,out he had promised,"...many of his army slain; **out he had promised** them well, and performed ill; and the citizens surrendered the city because the thanes had betrayed them.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,This appears to be a missing conjunction or an OCR error; 'but' or 'though' is required to connect the clauses logically.
21,9,Merle-Sweyne,"This summer the child Edgar departed, with his mother Agatha, and his two sisters, Margaret and Christina, and **Merle-Sweyne**, and many good men with them; and came to Scotland under the protection of King Malcolm, who entertained them all.",ErrorCategory.FACTUAL_INACCURACY,95,The more common and historically accurate spelling for this figure in the *Anglo-Saxon Chronicle* is 'Mærle-Sweyn' or 'Mearle-Sweyn'. 'Merle-Sweyne' is a less standard rendering.
22,10,England and so,The fortifications called castles by the Normans were scarcely known in **England and so** the English – in spite of that courage and love of fighting – could put up only weak resistance to their enemies.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,A comma before 'and so' would improve readability when joining two independent clauses.
23,11,the King Stephen,"1137 When **the King Stephen** came to England, he held his council at Oxford; and there he seized the Bishop, Roger, of Salisbury, and Alexander, Bishop of Lincoln, and the chancellor Roger, his nephew; and threw them all into prison until they gave up their castles.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The definite article 'the' is not typically used before a monarch's title and name in this construction; 'King Stephen' is the standard form.
24,11,"Bishop, Roger, of Salisbury","...he seized the **Bishop, Roger, of Salisbury**, and Alexander, Bishop of Lincoln, and the chancellor Roger, his nephew; and threw them all into prison until they gave up their castles.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The standard and grammatically correct form is 'Bishop Roger of Salisbury', without the additional commas."
25,11,"mild man, and soft, and good","...understood that Stephen was a **mild man, and soft, and good**, and did not execute harsh justice they became forgetful of their pledge to him.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,"The repeated use of 'and' in a list of adjectives is stylistically awkward; 'mild, soft, and good man' would be more concise and natural."
26,11,harsh justice they,...did not execute **harsh justice they** became forgetful of their pledge to him.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,A comma is needed after a long introductory clause to improve readability.
27,11,full of castles and they cruelly,"They filled the land **full of castles and they cruelly** oppressed the wretched men of the land with castle building, and when the castles were made, they filled them with devils and evil men.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,"'Filled the land with castles' is more concise and formal than 'filled the land full of castles', and the repetition of 'they' is redundant."
28,11,took they those,"Then **took they those** who they thought had any goods, both by night and by day, and threw them into prison for their gold and silver.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The inverted syntax 'took they' is archaic and should be 'they took' in modern English.

31,11,by their head,"Some were hung by their thumbs, others **by their head**, with coats of mail hung on their feet.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"When referring to multiple people, 'heads' (plural) or the idiomatic 'the head' should be used."
32,11,so heavy two or three men,...that were **so heavy two or three men** could only just carry one.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"A conjunction like 'that' is missing after 'so heavy' to complete the clause (e.g., 'so heavy that two or three men...')."
33,11,a sharp iron,"...and a **sharp iron** was placed around the man's throat and neck, so that he could turn in no direction, not sit, not lie, not sleep, just bear all that weight.",ErrorCategory.AMBIGUOUS_PHRASING,88,The phrase 'a sharp iron' is vague and could refer to various objects; 'a sharp iron collar' or 'device' would provide clarity.
34,11,"not sleep, just bear","...not sit, not lie, not sleep, **just bear** all that weight.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The parallel structure of the negative verbs is broken by 'just bear'; it should maintain the negative or use a contrasting conjunction (e.g., 'nor bear' or 'but only bear')."
35,11,thousands they killed,Many **thousands they killed** with hunger.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The inverted syntax 'thousands they killed' is archaic and should be 'they killed many thousands' in modern English.

37,11,and ever it grew,"...while Stephen was king, **and ever it grew** worse and worse.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The word 'ever' is archaic in this context; 'and it continually grew worse' or 'and it grew ever worse' would be more appropriate for modern formal writing.
38,12,most southern,...and it was the **most southern** of the castles built across the marches as a Norman defence against attacks from the Welsh.,ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,95,The correct superlative form for 'southern' is 'southernmost'.

40,14,were,"The end of the rope **were** then passed round his neck and carried round his throat and his chin, and there they finished off this dreadful engine of torture in a fifth knot …",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"Subject-verb agreement error: 'The end' is singular, so the verb should be 'was' instead of 'were'."
41,18,"conquered,","William had **conquered,** and secured the power of England, and the Normans had completely taken over.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,A comma should not separate a compound verb ('conquered and secured') when both verbs share the same subject.

44,19,would another marriage,No woman **would another marriage** or divorce without permission from the church courts or parliament for the next eight centuries.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The sentence is grammatically incomplete; a verb is missing after 'would' (e.g., 'would enter another marriage')."
45,21,forced be,"Matilda was the first Norman woman to inherit the English throne, and **forced be** the first queen militant – raising her own army and leading into battle for two years of skirmishes, until her victory at the Battle of Lincoln in 1141.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,The phrasing 'forced be' is grammatically incorrect; it should be 'was forced to be' or 'became'.

At this fearful moment the passengers and crew raised cries of distress but their mouths were soon stopped by the swelling waves and all perished together, except two who seized hold of the yard from which the **sale** was set …",ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,95,The word 'sale' is a homophone for 'sail' and is used incorrectly in the context of a ship's rigging.
