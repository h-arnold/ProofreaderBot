Overview of comparisons to other plague pandemics, including how they started, how long they lasted and their mortality rates.

The traditional explanation for the Black Death.

Alternative explanations for the causes of Black Death.

### Activities:

- research the details of the Black Death and other pandemics, focusing on causes, symptoms and mortality rates
- create a table to summarise this information
- identify similarities and differences between the data on these different pandemics
- explain the traditional theory for the spread of the Black Death involving fleas and rats
- research recent alternative explanations for spread of the Black Death including marmots and human to human contact.

### Outcome:

Learners can demonstrate that they understand the current debates about the nature and significance of the Black Death

### Advanced activity:

Contemporaries of the Black Death did not use this name for the disease at the time. Research the names that people gave the disease at the time and consider which terms you think would be more appropriate to use to describe it.

- how the Black Death affected central, western and northern Europe, including:
  - its impact in urban communities
  - its impact in rural communities.

Explain what the feudal system and the manor were.

How the Black Death affected rural communities, including deserted villages such as Comeston and Caldicot in Wales.

How the Black Death affected towns and cities such as London or Paris.

Differing experiences of cities such as Florence and Milan.

### Activities:

- outline what the feudal system was and what this meant in practice for villages
- describe how the Black Death impacted on rural communities based on research – examples could come from Wales, England or elsewhere in Europe

| Local, National &<br>International Contexts | Learners will understand that the Black Death connects villages in fourteenth century Wales to towns<br>and<br>villages across the rest of the British Isles, Europe, around the Mediterranean and the Near East of Asia as<br>the rapid spread and impact of this disease made it a transcontinental pandemic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |  |
| Sustainability                              | Learners will be introduced to recent ideas,<br>still being researched,<br>that climate change<br>may have<br>influenced<br>the spread of the Black Death.<br>In 2.2.1, learners will explore how climate change may have influenced an increase in, and migration of, the<br>rodent population in Asia and Europe, making it easier for the fleas carrying Black Death the spread further,<br>faster and in greater numbers. Food shortages resulting from the end of the Medieval Warm Period may also<br>have led to malnutrition making those of the edge of starvation more susceptible to the disease. |  |
| Relationships and Sexuality<br>Education    | Learners will see that the impact of the Black Death led to conflict between the landowning aristocracy<br>and the peasants forced to work on their land as the feudal system began to collapse. There was also a<br>rise in antisemitic violence as a result of the Black Death.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |  |
| Human Rights Education and<br>Diversity     | Learners will understand that the Black Death spread geographically, ignoring the political borders of<br>the Mongol and Ottoman Empires, travelled through the Mamluk Empire in the Near East into North<br>Africa, but then across the city states, empire and kingdoms of Europe.<br>The political impact of the Black Death ignored the nature and borders of political entities in the areas<br>affected by the Black Death. Not only did the Black Death lead to the end of feudalism in Europe but it<br>was an important element in ending the power of the Mongol Empire as well.                   |  |

# Careers and Work-Related Experiences

Learners will understand the economic importance of the merchants of the Silk Road and the Mediterranean Sea routes in this period, although they are no longer important in the modern world. They will also see how the medical profession was much less professional, and much less based in science in the medieval period.

Learners will also understand that the priests who worked for the Church in Europe were much more important in medieval times than they are today. It was through them that the Christians of Europe came to see the Black Death as a religious rather than natural phenomenon.

{44}------------------------------------------------

### Cross-curricular Skills - Literacy

There are many opportunities to include Literacy in GCSE History. These opportunities include the analysis of source material, extended writing opportunities, vocabulary development, debating and discussion. These opportunities are important to learners because they will develop cross-curricular skills which underpin the four purposes of the Curriculum for Wales, as well as communication skills which can be used across subjects and prepare them for future education or employment.

Below are some examples of how Literacy can be embedded into teaching and learning for GCSE History.

Learners will have the opportunity to assess the accuracy and reliability of source material and share views through discussion and verbal questioning techniques when being taught the specification content.

### Examples

### Listening

- Learners are encouraged to debate and respond to the views of others.
- Learners will have opportunities to listen to podcasts and recordings in order to develop their vocabulary and listening skills.
- Use of oral history and interviews develop listening skills and the ability to respond to others appropriately.
- Learners have the opportunity to share and respond to peer presentations.

### Learners will have the opportunity to read contemporary source material as well as a variety of historical interpretations, before critically evaluating the sources, analysing their content, and comparing and contrasting sources focusing on the interpretation they give on events.

# Reading

### Examples

- Learners can use a range of reading techniques such as skimming and scanning or reading for a purpose.
- Reading extracts from a wide range of sources such as speeches, articles, diary extracts, historians and newspapers.
- Comparing and contrasting the content of historical sources.
- Assessing the reliability and accuracy of the text to develop the skill of critical reading.

{45}------------------------------------------------

| Speaking | Learners will have the opportunity to develop their understanding of viewpoints and content through debate, discussion, presentations and group work.                                                                                         |

{46}------------------------------------------------

### Cross-curricular Skills - Numeracy

There are many opportunities to include Numeracy in GCSE History, for example analysing population change, interpreting statistics in primary and secondary sources, analysing graphs and timelines and engaging with concepts such as chronological awareness. These opportunities are important to learners because it allows them to contextualise events and quantify change. Learners can draw evidencebased conclusions based on statistics and numerical data.

Below are some examples of how Numeracy can be embedded into teaching and learning for GCSE History.

Learning about geometry helps us understand shape, space and position and learning about measurement helps us quantify in the real world

Learners will have opportunities to analyse maps in order to understand the growth and development of empires or the geographical representation of wars.

### Examples

- Learners can analyse maps, structures and artifacts.
- Learners can then analyse land division and urban planning.
- There are opportunities to analyse military strategies and fortifications.

Learning that statistics represent data and that probability models chance help us make informed inferences and decisions

Learners will have the opportunities to examine or interpret data and graphs through source analysis.

### Examples

- Learners can analyse data to draw conclusions on statistics such as population growth, costs and land expansion.
- Secondary material such as graphs and charts can be interpreted.
- There are opportunities for learners to create their own numerical representations of data gathered.

{47}------------------------------------------------

### Cross-curricular Skills - Digital Competence

There are many opportunities to include Digital Competence in GCSE History. Learners can make use of digital technology to access a broad range of historical sources and to undertake research of a historical topic. Learners will also have the opportunity to develop their digital skills in preparing and completing their non-examination assessments. These opportunities will allow learners to develop crosscurricular skills which underpin the four purposes of the curriculum, as well as allowing further access to historical information while fostering current and future critical thinking and ethical awareness.

Below are some examples of how Digital Competence can be embedded into teaching and learning for GCSE History.

# Citizenship Learners will develop an understanding of the importance of attributions, including the use of resources in digital formats such as e-books and online articles. Learners will be required to address attributions when analysing items for their historical enquiry and to think critically about the authors of digital evidence. Example Learners should be made aware of copyright and plagiarism when looking at historical evidence and when developing and presenting their own arguments in relation to a topic. Interacting and Collaborating Learners can work collaboratively (digitally) on tasks in preparation for the exam. These could include peer assessment, responding to teacher feedback or work creation. Example In groups, learners could research and present a topic to introduce an area of study. Producing Learners will have opportunities to research a variety of sources digitally and will develop digital skills when producing non-examinations assessments in a digital format. Examples • Use of national and international archives to find source materials that link to the area of study. • Complete the assessment using digital technology.

{48}------------------------------------------------

# Integral Skills Creativity and Innovation There are many opportunities to include Creativity and Innovation in GCSE History. These opportunities are important to learners to become more engaged in lessons and enjoy learning through stimulating tasks. Deeper understanding is developed through the encouragement for learners to take an active role in their learning. Examples • Learners will demonstrate creativity when developing responses, expressing their opinions about relevant historical issues and critically evaluating sources and evidence within assessments. • Learners have opportunities to be creative and innovative when presenting information and findings. Critical Thinking and Problem Solving There are many opportunities to include Critical Thinking and Problem Solving in GCSE History. These opportunities are important to learners because they develop the ability to think analytically, and to collect, reflect and critically evaluate evidence in order to make informed judgements on a range of topics. This skill can be applied to real-life scenarios. Examples • Learners will have opportunities to ask meaningful questions of source material and historical interpretations, as well as to evaluate them as part of their process of developing relevant critical arguments. • Learners will develop their ability to see issues from multiple viewpoints. • Studying continuity and change over time allows learners to develop their problem-solving skills that can be applied in their future lives. • Learners will evaluate sources and historical interpretations in terms of reliability, bias and purpose. • Critical thinking and problem solving encourages independent learning and promotes the ability to come to

reasoned and informed decisions in other aspects of life such as further education or work.
