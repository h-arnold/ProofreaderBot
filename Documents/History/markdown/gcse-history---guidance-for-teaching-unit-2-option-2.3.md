- the Spanish conquest of the Caribbean, including:
  - the peoples of the Caribbean – exploitation of the people and the land
  - reasons for Spanish expansion into Mexico.

The Taino and the Caribs (native peoples of the Caribbean).

The enslavement of the Indigenous Peoples to farm the land.

The lack of gold (identified by 1519) in the Caribbean and the appeal of central America.

### Activity:

Groupwork presentation activity. Each group is given a different theme to research in relation to the Spanish conquest of the Caribbean, for example, the treatment of Indigenous Peoples, and then feeds back to the rest of the class. The rest of the class should take notes during the presentations.

### Outcome:

Learners can demonstrate that they understand the way the Spanish took over the Caribbean and used the people and land to their own benefit. Learners can also demonstrate that they understand why the Spanish moved onto Central America, namely Mexico.

### Advanced activity:

Learners can be given challenge questions to encourage thinking about other reasons for Spanish expansion e.g. why would Roman Catholic missionaries be attracted to the Caribbean?

### Advanced outcome:

Learners can explore other reasons for the Spanish conquest e.g. religion.

  - the impact on Europe, including increased trade, wealth and the consequences of inflation.

The encomienda system.

Royal authority and the establishment of governors of the new Spain.

The expansion of trade routes.

### Activity:

Use the information from the suggested resources to create a set of diagrams with detailed labels to show the new structures of society, including the encomienda system and royal authority.

Use these diagrams to examine the impact of these new structures on the Aztecs and Europe.

### Outcome:

Learners can demonstrate that they understand how Mexico changed under the Spanish, and the economic and political impact of the conquest on the Spanish Empire.

### Advanced activity:

Facilitate a debate on whether the benefits of increased trade and wealth outweighed the impacts on indigenous societies.

### Advanced outcome:

Learners can develop a nuanced understanding of the conquest and it's far-reaching effects.
