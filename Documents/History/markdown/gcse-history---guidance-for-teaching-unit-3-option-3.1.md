# Qualification Structure

WJEC GCSE History consists of four units. The combination of options selected for Units 1, 2 and 3 must include one medieval, one early modern and one modern unit.

In Unit 4, centres can choose to repeat a time period previously studied in Units 1, 2 or 3. **However, the topics chosen for study in Unit 4 must not replicate or overlap with the content of any of the other selected units.**

The qualification is unitised and does not contain tiering. There is no hierarchy to the order the units should be taught.

• the nature of Viking society and Viking beliefs.

Viking life, including, houses, clothes and food.

The structure of Viking society, including thralls, bondi and jarls.

The role of women in Viking society.

The importance of ships and sea-faring to the Vikings.

The main features of Viking religion, including their religious rituals and sites, as well as their beliefs about the gods and the concept of Ragnarök.

### Activities:

- Draw a diagram to illustrate the hierarchy of Viking society.
- Divide the learners into groups – each group to focus on researching either Viking life, the role of women, the importance of the sea or Viking religion. After the research, reorganise groups so that there is at least one learner from each of the original groups to share information, so all learners end up with all of the information.

### Outcome:

Learners can show their understanding of Viking society as well as the main beliefs of the Viking religion.

### Advanced activity:

Learners could discuss which was more important in the life of the Vikings – their ships or their gods.

### Advanced outcome:

Learners can draw conclusions about the extent to which Viking society was religious.

- the nature of settlement of Greenland, including:
  - Eric the Red
  - the western and eastern settlements.

How the banishment of the criminal Eric the Red from Iceland resulted in his exploration of the coast of Greenland and the discovery of inhabitable lands.

The settlements established in 986 for hunting, farming and trading.

The impact of climate change and the decline of Viking settlements in Greenland from their peak in the 1050s.

### Activities:

- On a map of Greenland, record the route the Vikings took to get there and the locations of their main settlements (western and eastern).
- Explain why the Vikings eventually abandoned these settlements.

### Outcome:

Learners can demonstrate that they understand what the Viking settlement of Greenland was like.

### Advanced activity:

With the information here link back to 3.1 and consider how much climate, particularly the medieval warm period, influenced Viking trading and colonisation.

### Advanced outcome:

Learners can draw conclusions about the extent to which climate change influenced Viking explorations and settlement.

- the exploration of the North American coast, including:
  - Leif Erikson
- the Leifsbudir in Vinland.

The role of Leif Erikson, son of Eric the Red, in following up on a story of a ship that had got lost to the west of Greenland and had sighted an unknown land.

Leif Eriksons wintering at a site known as Leifsbuoir and his description of this land as Vinland (Wineland).

The lack of permanent settlements leaving these stories as a myth until the discovery of archaeological evidence of these Viking sites in 1960 at L'Anse aux Meadows and in 2016 at Point Rosee.

### Activities:

- On a map of the northeastern coast of North America, plot Leif Erikson's probable route and the landing sights.
- Explain how modern archaeology has proved that the Vikings did visit North America.

### Outcome:

Learners can show their understanding of the nature of Viking contact with North America.

### Advanced activities:

- Compare Viking contact with Iceland, Greenland and America, looking for similarities and differences.
- How different was Viking contact with America compared to other Viking exploration that has been studied?

### Advanced outcome:

Learners can draw conclusions about the extent of Viking contact with North America.

- the last of the Viking rulers, including:
  - Harthacnut
  - Harald Hardrada and the Battle of Stamford Bridge.

The brief reign of Harthacnut as king of England between 1040 and 1042 after the death of his half-brother Harald Harefoot.

The throne of England went to Edward the Confessor, son of king Ethelred, an Anglo-Saxon king with family connections to the dukes of Normandy.

Harald Hardrada became king of Norway in 1046, losing the throne of Denmark to Sweyn II. In 1066 he invaded northern England to claim the throne after Edward's death but was killed at the Battle of Stamford Bridge.

### Activities:

- Explain how Edward the Confessor became king and what this meant for Viking rule in England.
- Research and write a report on the fate of Harald Hardrada both in Scandinavia and in England.

### Outcome:

Learners can demonstrate that they understand how Viking rule in England came to an end.

### Advanced activities:

- Compare what happened to the Vikings in England over time, considering events from 3.1.2, 3.1.4 and 3.1.5. What similarities and differences can be found?
- Consider the importance of the victory of the Normans in 1066 and its importance for England as they were descended from Vikings.
- How important were the Vikings in the history of England?

The optional topics provide opportunities to enhance learners' understanding of the world and the diverse experiences of its peoples. Options allow for the study of marginalised regions of the world, the histories of dispossessed peoples and forgotten empires, especially of the global South.<br>Option 3.1 Medieval: The Vikings, c.750 – c.1066 allows centres and learners to explore medieval history within Northern Europe and the Atlantic. Viking raids within Britain involve locations from Lindisfarne to Sheppey in eastern England, as well as the Orkney and Shetland islands in Scotland and across the Irish Sea in Ireland. However, these national connections are then linked into Scandinavia as well as raids in Europe on France and Spain, trading through what is now modern Russia and Ukraine, the Byzantine Empire and the Muslim trading networks centred around Baghdad. |

{41}------------------------------------------------

## Cross-curricular Skills – Numeracy

There are many opportunities to include numeracy in GCSE History, for example analysing population change, interpreting statistics in primary and secondary sources, analysing graphs and timelines and engaging with concepts such as chronological awareness. These opportunities are important to learners because it allows them to contextualise events and quantify change. Learners can draw evidencebased conclusions based on statistics and numerical data.

Below are some examples of how numeracy can be embedded into teaching and learning for GCSE History.

Learning about geometry helps us understand shape, space and position and learning about measurement helps us quantify in the real world

Learners will have opportunities to analyse maps in order to understand the growth and development of empires or the geographical representation of wars.

### Examples

- Learners can analyse maps, structures and artifacts.
- Learners can then analyse land division and urban planning.
- There are opportunities to analyse military strategies and fortifications.

Learning that statistics represent data, and that probability models chance, help us make informed inferences and decisions

Learners will have the opportunities to examine or interpret data and graphs through source analysis.

### Examples

- Learners can analyse data to draw conclusions on statistics such as population growth, costs and land expansion.
- Secondary material such as graphs and charts can be interpreted.
- There are opportunities for learners to create their own numerical representations of data gathered.

{42}------------------------------------------------

## Cross-curricular Skills – Digital Competence

There are many opportunities to include digital competence in GCSE History. Learners can make use of digital technology to access a broad range of historical sources and to undertake research of a historical topic. Learners will also have the opportunity to develop their digital skills in preparing and completing their non-examination assessments. These opportunities will allow Learners to develop cross-curricular skills which underpin the four purposes of the curriculum, as well as allowing further access to historical information while fostering current and future critical thinking and ethical awareness.

Below are some examples of how digital competence can be embedded into teaching and learning for GCSE History.

| Citizenship                      | Learners will develop an understanding of the importance of attributions, including the use of resources in digital formats such as e-books and online articles. Learners will be required to address attributions when analysing items for their historical enquiry and to think critically about the authors of digital evidence. |
