- the impact of Genghis Khan's social revolution, including:
  - the military decimal system
  - yassa, the oral law code.

The reorganisation of the military into units in multiples of ten in the style of the old Roman imperial army.

The role of the generals in the Mongol army and the role they played in military tactics.

The yassa, the new oral law code that now applied throughout the Mongol Empire.

## Activities:

- draw a diagram to show how the Mongol army was reorganised using the decimal system
- explain how this reorganisation made the Mongol army more effective
- research and explain the rights the new law code gave to the citizens of the Mongol Empire
- discuss how this compares to the rights of citizens of Wales today.

## Outcome:

Learners can demonstrate that they understand how the reforms of Genghis Khan improved the effectiveness of the military as well as guaranteeing the rights of people within the Mongol Empire.

## Advanced activities:

- compare the military reforms of Genghis Khan to the imperial Roman army, using the link to the Roman Army from the BBC Bitesize website
- discuss the similarities and differences between the ancient Roman and Mongol armies.

There are also opportunities for debates, such as:

- how effectively Temujin became khan, with one side arguing he was very efficient and the other side arguing how precarious his victory was
- which was the most important reason for the Mongol Conquest of the Khwarazmian Empire – the weakness of the empire, the murder of the Mongol envoys or the importance of accessing the Silk Road.

| Local, National &<br>International Contexts | Option 2.1 Genghis Khan c.1162–c.1227 allows learners to explore international medieval history within Asia, from the steppes of the nomadic Mongol tribes, through to the Khwarazmian Empire in the west of Asia, to the kingdoms of Western Xia and the Jin dynasty in eastern Asia. There are also links to the ancient Silk Road, the trading route from the eastern coast of China to eastern Mediterranean and northern Africa.                                                                                                                                                                                         |  |

# Human Rights Education and Diversity

Learners will understand that the study of Genghis Khan is a study of imperialism as the Mongol Empire spread across Asia and that the countries conquered by the Mongols were colonised as well, their local laws being replaced by the Mongo law code. This Empire stretched across Asia and encompassed many different peoples, from the Mongol nomads to the Chinese in the east and the Muslims in the West.

Learners should understand the violent nature of Temujin's rise to power consolidating his control over the Mongol Tribes, the significance of the title Genghis Khan, and the destruction caused by the Mongol subjugation of two of the kingdoms of China, as well as the Muslim empire to the west.

Learners should engage with the toleration and appreciation of diversity within the Mongol law code that was imposed upon its territories.

{40}------------------------------------------------

## Cross-curricular Skills - Numeracy

There are many opportunities to include Numeracy in GCSE History, for example analysing population change, interpreting statistics in primary and secondary sources, analysing graphs and timelines and engaging with concepts such as chronological awareness. These opportunities are important to learners because it allows them to contextualise events and quantify change. Learners can draw evidencebased conclusions based on statistics and numerical data.

Below are some examples of how Numeracy can be embedded into teaching and learning for GCSE History.

Learning about geometry helps us understand shape, space and position and learning about measurement helps us quantify in the real world

Learners will have opportunities to analyse maps in order to understand the growth and development of empires or the geographical representation of wars.

## Examples

- Learners can analyse maps, structures and artifacts.
- Learners can then analyse land division and urban planning.
- There are opportunities to analyse military strategies and fortifications.

Learning that statistics represent data and that probability models chance help us make informed inferences and decisions

Learners will have the opportunities to examine or interpret data and graphs through source analysis.

## Examples

- Learners can analyse data to draw conclusions on statistics such as population growth, costs and land expansion.
- Secondary material such as graphs and charts can be interpreted.
- There are opportunities for learners to create their own numerical representations of data gathered.

{41}------------------------------------------------

## Cross-curricular Skills - Digital Competence

There are many opportunities to include Digital Competence in GCSE History. Learners can make use of digital technology to access a broad range of historical sources and to undertake research of a historical topic. Learners will also have the opportunity to develop their digital skills in preparing and completing their non-examination assessments. These opportunities will allow learners to develop crosscurricular skills which underpin the four purposes of the curriculum, as well as allowing further access to historical information while fostering current and future critical thinking and ethical awareness.

Below are some examples of how Digital Competence can be embedded into teaching and learning for GCSE History.

| Citizenship                      | Learners will develop an understanding of the importance of attributions, including the use of resources in digital formats such as e-books and online articles. Learners will be required to address attributions when analysing items for their historical enquiry and to think critically about the authors of digital evidence. |
