WJEC GCSE History consists of four units. The combination of options selected for Units 1, 2 and 3 must include one medieval, one early modern and one modern unit.

The qualification is unitised and does not contain tiering. There is no hierarchy to the order the units should be taught.

- the events of the rising, including:
  - radicalism and the forming of a political union
  - protests at the Court of Requests, Castle Inn and Penydarren House.

The course of the rising.

The demands of the rebels.

The nature and impact of protests at the Court of Requests, the Castle Inn and at Penydarren House.

#### **Activity:**

Watch *Wales and the History of the World - Merthyr Rising* and discuss why the Merthyr Rising is seen as being such an important event in the history of the working class.

Research and devise a timeline of the events of the Merthyr Rising, include at least the following:

- the development of radicalism in the early nineteenth century
- the forming of political unions among workers
- the role of William Crawshay
- the sacking of 'puddlers'
- the role of Lewis Lewis
- raising of the red flag
- events at the Court of Requests (debtors' court)
- events at the Castle Inn
- events at Penydarren House

Learners can use the *Merthyr Rising - Wikipedia* article, pages 9–15 of the *CADW comic*, the *Marxist.com* article and the *It's kicking off in South Wales!* video. Given the complexity of *Marxist.com* article, this could be split into sections and given to different groups.

Examine the demands of the protestors: what were they and what did they hope to achieve?

The reasons for and outcomes of the Great Reform Act, 1832.

Make notes in preparation to discuss: why was there fear of revolution in Britain up to c.1832? In two groups, learners will complete either The National Archive's 1832 Great Reform Act or 1834 Poor Law resource. They will summarise the reasons for and impact of the respective Act and present their findings to the other group. Use resources to consider life in the workhouses and the impact of the 1834 Poor Law on people in Wales. Watch the video resources and compare the promises of the 1832 Great Reform Act with its outcomes in Wales. Write a paragraph discussing why radical groups may have felt disillusioned. Outcome: Learners can demonstrate an understanding of the failures of attempts to reform up to this point. | Website(s): Why was reform needed? - Pressure for democratic reform up to 1884 - National 5 History Revision - BBC Bitesize What caused the 1832 Great Reform Act? - The National Archives 1834 Poor Law - The National Archives Welfare cuts and crime in 19th-century England and Wales Workhouses in Wales The Workhouse in Carmarthen, Carmarthenshire Book(s): Royle, E and Lockyer, R. 1997.

- the impact of Chartism, including:
  - the Newport Rising, 1839
  - the short-term failures and long-term successes of Chartism.

The events of the march on Newport in 1839 including the long march to Newport and the reaction of the authorities.

The treatment of the Newport Chartists in the months after the march, including John Frost and Zephaniah Williams.

The short-term failures and longterm successes of the Chartist movement.

#### **Activities:**

Use the *BBC Bitesize* resources and the *What was the Newport Rising?* video and develop a flowchart that explains the reasons for and process of the Newport Rising.

Discuss: Why was Newport a particular focus for the Chartist movement?

Watch the *Why did the Second Chartist petition of 1842 fail?* video and make notes. Then watch the *What was the significance of Chartism?* video and supplement those notes. In groups prepare arguments for and against the significance of Chartism. Considering the short-term failure and long-term achievement of most of the People's Charter's aims, to what extent was the Chartist movement a success?

#### **Outcome:**

Learners can demonstrate an understanding of the impact of Chartism on the people of Wales.

#### **Advanced activity:**

Watch/listen to the final section of *19th Century Welsh insurrection* (from 28:43) and make notes. Was the Chartist movement the catalyst for effective electoral reform in the UK?

# **Advanced outcome:**

Learners can debate the long-term impact of Chartism on the voting system today.

#### **Cross-curricular Skills - Literacy**

There are many opportunities to include Literacy in GCSE History. These opportunities include the analysis of source material, extended writing opportunities, vocabulary development, debating and discussion. These opportunities are important to learners because they will develop cross-curricular skills which underpin the four purposes of the Curriculum for Wales, as well as communication skills which can be used across subjects and prepare them for future education or employment.

Below are some examples of how Literacy can be embedded into teaching and learning for GCSE History.

#### **Cross-curricular Skills - Numeracy**

There are many opportunities to include Numeracy in GCSE History, for example analysing population change, interpreting statistics in primary and secondary sources, analysing graphs and timelines and engaging with concepts such as chronological awareness. These opportunities are important to learners because it allows them to contextualise events and quantify change. Learners can draw evidencebased conclusions based on statistics and numerical data.

Below are some examples of how Numeracy can be embedded into teaching and learning for GCSE History.

Learning about geometry helps us understand shape, space and position and learning about measurement helps us quantify in the real world

Learners will have opportunities to analyse maps in order to understand the growth and development of empires or the geographical representation of wars.

#### **Examples**

- Learners can analyse maps, structures and artifacts.
- Learners can then analyse land division and urban planning.
- There are opportunities to analyse military strategies and fortifications.

Learning that statistics represent data, and that probability models chance, help us make informed inferences and decisions

Learners will have the opportunities to examine or interpret data and graphs through source analysis.

#### **Examples**

- Learners can analyse data to draw conclusions on statistics such as population growth, costs and land expansion.
- Secondary material such as graphs and charts can be interpreted.
- There are opportunities for learners to create their own numerical representations of data gathered.

{37}------------------------------------------------

#### **Cross-curricular Skills - Digital Competence**

There are many opportunities to include Digital Competence in GCSE History. Learners can make use of digital technology to access a broad range of historical sources and to undertake research of a historical topic. Learners will also have the opportunity to develop their digital skills in preparing and completing their non-examination assessments. These opportunities will allow learners to develop crosscurricular skills which underpin the four purposes of the curriculum, as well as allowing further access to historical information while fostering current and future critical thinking and ethical awareness.

Below are some examples of how Digital Competence can be embedded into teaching and learning for GCSE History.

| Citizenship | Learners will develop an understanding of the importance of attributions, including the use of resources in digital formats such as e-books and online articles. Learners will be required to address attributions when analysing items for their historical enquiry and to think critically about the authors of digital evidence. |
