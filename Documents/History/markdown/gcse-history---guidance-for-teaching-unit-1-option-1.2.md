| participate in educational visits in person or digitally | Some of the sites associated with Owain Glyndwr can be visited in person, such as Harlech Castle and the Parliament in Machynlleth. There is also information about him in the museum in Llangollen, near where he was born, and St. Chad's church in Hanmer where he got married is still a working church. |
| develop empathy, tolerance, compassion and curiosity through studying different historical contexts | English attitudes towards the Welsh in the post Edwardian Conquest period allow for learners to reflect on how conflict can arise from poor treatment of one group of people by another, but also that this conflict was ultimately resolved through conciliation. |
| engage in collaborative working | There are many opportunities for discussion, such as: <ul><li>what the strengths and weaknesses were of English control over Wales by the end of the 14th century</li><li>to what extent Owain Glyndwr seemed to be more like an English lord than a Welsh prince</li><li>how important it was to have someone like John of Gaunt as a patron</li><li>to what extent learners think that Owain Glyndwr's relationship with Henry Bolingbroke is the same as he had with John of Gaunt, Bolingbroke's father</li><li>how secure the government of Owain Glyndwr was</li><li>what the indenture, the treaty with France and the Pennal letter tell us about the weaknesses of Owain Glyndwr's position as Tywysog Cymru</li><li>the extent to which Owain Glyndwr's defeat was more about the strength of the English rather than the weakness of the Welsh. The are also opportunities for debates, such as:</li><li>the extent to which Wales in this period was influenced by England, with one side arguing it was greatly influenced by England and the other side that it was not.</li></ul> |

# Opportunities for embedding elements of the Curriculum for Wales

<span id="page-42-0"></span>

| Curriculum for Wales Strands                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |  |
|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--|
| Cross-cutting Themes                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |  |
|  | Unit 1 provides centres with six different historical topics relating to the history of a range of areas within Wales, allowing local or national contexts to be explored with learners. |  |
| Local, National & International Contexts | Option 1.2 Medieval: Owain Glyndwr, c.1354 – 1416 allows centres and learners to explore medieval history within North Wales. There are a number of locations in North Wales associated with Owain Glyndwr including Harlech Castle which the centre of his government, but also Conwy Castle which his supporters took from the English early in the revolt. In northeastern Wales, there are a number of sites associated with Glyndwr including St. Chad's church in Hanmer and there is also the Parliament in Machynlleth, Mid Wales. |  |
| Relationships and Sexuality Education | This unit considers the perspective of the Welsh, after their resentment towards the English, as a result of being treated as second class citizens since the Edwardian Conquest. Learners will explore the reasons behind support for Glyndwr's Welsh Revolt, including the lack of opportunities for Welsh people, events that increased support in Wales for the revolt and the impact of Henry IV's penal laws |  |
| Human Rights Education and Diversity | Wales had been colonised by the English after being conquered in the 13th century. By the late 14th century, the English were acting as a colonial power in Wales, treating the native Welsh as if they were second class citizens in their own country. Learners will explore the significance of the Edwardian settlement, as well as Welsh rebellions against English rule. |  |
| Careers and Work-Related Experiences | Most of the military roles in the medieval warfare covered by this unit are no longer part of the work done by people in the armed forces today. Owain Glyndwr's role as a squire, with the aim of eventually becoming a knight is very different to the aspirations of people in Wales today. |  |

{45}------------------------------------------------

# **Cross-curricular Skills - Numeracy**

There are many opportunities to include Numeracy in GCSE History, for example analysing population change, interpreting statistics in primary and secondary sources, analysing graphs and timelines and engaging with concepts such as chronological awareness. These opportunities are important to learners because it allows them to contextualise events and quantify change. Learners can draw evidencebased conclusions based on statistics and numerical data.

Below are some examples of how numeracy can be embedded into teaching and learning for GCSE History:

Learning about geometry helps us understand shape, space and position and learning about measurement helps us quantify in the real world

Learners will have opportunities to analyse maps in order to understand the growth and development of empires or the geographical representation of wars.

#### **Examples**

- Learners can analyse maps, structures and artifacts.
- Learners can then analyse land division and urban planning.
- There are opportunities to analyse military strategies and fortifications.

Learning that statistics represent data, and that probability models chance, help us make informed inferences and decisions

Learners will have the opportunities to examine or interpret data and graphs through source analysis.

# **Examples**

- Learners can analyse data to draw conclusions on statistics such as population growth, costs and land expansion.
- Secondary material such as graphs and charts can be interpreted.
- There are opportunities for learners to create their own numerical representations of data gathered.

{46}------------------------------------------------

## **Cross-curricular Skills - Digital Competence**

There are many opportunities to include Digital Competence in GCSE History. Learners can make use of digital technology to access a broad range of historical sources and to undertake research of a historical topic. Learners will also have the opportunity to develop their digital skills in preparing and completing their non-examination assessments. These opportunities will allow learners to develop crosscurricular skills which underpin the four purposes of the curriculum, as well as allowing further access to historical information while fostering current and future critical thinking and ethical awareness.

Below are some examples of how digital competence can be embedded into teaching and learning for GCSE History:

| Citizenship | Learners will develop an understanding of the importance of attributions, including the use of resources in digital formats such as e-books and online articles. Learners will be required to address attributions when analysing items for their historical enquiry and to think critically about the authors of digital evidence. |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                                  | Example                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|  | Learners should be made aware of copyright and plagiarism when looking at historical evidence and when developing and presenting their own arguments in relation to a topic. |
| Interacting and Collaborating | Learners can work collaboratively (digitally) on tasks in preparation for the exam. These could include peer assessment, responding to teacher feedback or work creation. |
|                                  | Example                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|                                  | In groups, learners could research and present a topic to introduce an area of study.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Producing | Learners have opportunities to research a variety of sources digitally. |
|                                  | Example                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
