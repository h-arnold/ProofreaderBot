# Qualification Structure

WJEC GCSE History consists of four units. The combination of options selected for Units 1, 2 and 3 must include one medieval, one early modern and one modern unit.

In Unit 4, centres can choose to repeat a time period previously studied in Units 1, 2 or 3. **However, the topics chosen for study in Unit 4 must not replicate or overlap with the content of any of the other selected units.**

The qualification is unitised and does not contain tiering. There is no hierarchy to the order the units should be taught.

Compare what has been learned about Wales overall to what was initially considered for Crickhowell and consider how representative of Wales medieval Crickhowell seems.

#### Outcome:

- the early successes of the revolt, including:
  - Glyndwr's dispute with Lord Grey
  - the Battle of Mynydd Hyddgen, 1401.

Glyndwr's legal dispute with Lord Grey.

The beginnings of Glyndwr's revolt from Ruthin to Conwy.

The Battle of Mynydd Hyddgen and its consequences for Wales.

# Activities:

Explain how Glyndwr's legal dispute with Lord Grey of Ruthin led to his declaring of a revolt against the King of England.

Make a brief timeline with details of the main events from the declaring of the revolt in Ruthin to the Battle of Mynydd Hyddgen.

Explain the concept of a chevauchee and how it was used by both sides in the early part of Glyndwr's revolt.

Explain what happened at the Battle of Mynydd Hyddgen and why it was a victory for the Welsh.

#### Outcome:

Learners can show their understanding of the early development of Glyndwr's revolt from a legal dispute with a neighbouring lord to defeating the English army in open battle.

#### Advanced activity:

Listen to the Half Arsed History podcast on Owain Glyndwr from 8.30 to 20.35 and make notes on the different ways that Glyndwr and his supporters were able to achieve their aims in the first years of the revolt – which method was the most successful?

# Opportunities for embedding elements of the Curriculum for Wales

<span id="page-42-0"></span>

{44}------------------------------------------------

## Cross-curricular Skills - Literacy

There are many opportunities to include Literacy in GCSE History. These opportunities include the analysis of source material, extended writing opportunities, vocabulary development, debating and discussion. These opportunities are important to learners because they will develop cross-curricular skills which underpin the four purposes of the Curriculum for Wales, as well as communication skills which can be used across subjects and prepare them for future education or employment.

Below are some examples of how literacy can be embedded into teaching and learning for GCSE History:

{45}------------------------------------------------

| Speaking | Learners will have the opportunity to develop their understanding of viewpoints and content through debate, discussion, presentations and group work.                                                                                         |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|          | <b>Examples</b>                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|          | Debating the most important reason why an event happenedAsking questions for clarification and development of understanding.Learners can develop speaking skills through group and pair work.                                                 |
| Writing  | Learners will have the opportunity to use a range of subject-specific vocabulary, idiomatic language and be able to present their work digitally. They will also have opportunities to reflect on the structure and content of their writing. |
|          | <b>Examples</b>                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|          | Role modelling of answers through teacher, peer and self-assessment activities.Learners have the opportunity to use a wide range of writing styles such as formal, informal and first person.                                                 |

{46}------------------------------------------------

# Cross-curricular Skills - Numeracy

There are many opportunities to include Numeracy in GCSE History, for example analysing population change, interpreting statistics in primary and secondary sources, analysing graphs and timelines and engaging with concepts such as chronological awareness. These opportunities are important to learners because it allows them to contextualise events and quantify change. Learners can draw evidencebased conclusions based on statistics and numerical data.

Below are some examples of how numeracy can be embedded into teaching and learning for GCSE History:

Learning about geometry helps us understand shape, space and position and learning about measurement helps us quantify in the real world

Learners will have opportunities to analyse maps in order to understand the growth and development of empires or the geographical representation of wars.

#### Examples

- Learners can analyse maps, structures and artifacts.
- Learners can then analyse land division and urban planning.
- There are opportunities to analyse military strategies and fortifications.

Learning that statistics represent data, and that probability models chance, help us make informed inferences and decisions

Learners will have the opportunities to examine or interpret data and graphs through source analysis.

# Examples

- Learners can analyse data to draw conclusions on statistics such as population growth, costs and land expansion.
- Secondary material such as graphs and charts can be interpreted.
- There are opportunities for learners to create their own numerical representations of data gathered.

{47}------------------------------------------------

## Cross-curricular Skills - Digital Competence

There are many opportunities to include Digital Competence in GCSE History. Learners can make use of digital technology to access a broad range of historical sources and to undertake research of a historical topic. Learners will also have the opportunity to develop their digital skills in preparing and completing their non-examination assessments. These opportunities will allow learners to develop crosscurricular skills which underpin the four purposes of the curriculum, as well as allowing further access to historical information while fostering current and future critical thinking and ethical awareness.

Below are some examples of how digital competence can be embedded into teaching and learning for GCSE History:

| Citizenship                              | Learners will develop an understanding of the importance of attributions, including the use of resources in digital formats such as e-books and online articles. Learners will be required to address attributions when analysing items for their historical enquiry and to think critically about the authors of digital evidence.<br><b>Example</b><br>Learners should be made aware of copyright and plagiarism when looking at historical evidence and when developing and presenting their own arguments in relation to a topic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
