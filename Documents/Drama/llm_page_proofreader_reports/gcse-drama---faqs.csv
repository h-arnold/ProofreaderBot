0,1,Unit 2 (30%) and an on-screen,"The course is a linear qualification with two practical non-examination assessments, Unit 1 (40%) and **Unit 2 (30%) and an on-screen** examination unit, Unit 3 (30%).",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,A comma before the final 'and' would improve clarity by separating the two main types of assessment in this complex sentence structure.
1,1,year 10,Unit 1 can be completed earlier in the course (for example at the end of **year 10**) but must be submitted at the end of the course.,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,95,'Year 10' should be capitalised for consistency with 'Years 10 and 11' used elsewhere in the document.
2,2,which contains instructions,Your Exams Officer will be able to access a circular nearer the time **which contains instructions** about using IAMIS.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,'That' is generally preferred over 'which' for restrictive clauses in formal British English to specify the circular.
3,2,meaning there is no word count,There are no restrictions on how the Reflective Log is to be submitted; **meaning there is no word count** and there are also no restrictions regarding the format in which the log is to be submitted.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,"The participial phrase 'meaning there is no word count' should be rephrased for greater formality, e.g., 'which means there is no word count'."
4,2,etc,"Formatting options include, but are not limited to written prose, PowerPoint presentation, vlog, blog, scrapbook **etc.**",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,A comma should precede 'etc.' when it follows a list of items.
5,3,final assessment complete,"Once work is underway, feedback must be limited to general advice about what needs to be improved. Teachers must not provide specific or detailed guidance on how to make these improvements, make creative decisions or direct. Once the work is finished and the **final assessment complete**, no further amendments may be made to the work.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The phrase 'final assessment complete' is missing a linking verb; it should be 'final assessment is complete' or 'final assessment completed'.
6,4,different to,"A: The text selected must be **different to** the set text selected for study in Unit 3. Furthermore, it is important to be mindful of ensuring each candidate is exposed to a range of texts from different time periods and cultures, and texts performed in a range of styles.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,"In formal British English, 'different from' is generally preferred over 'different to'."
7,4,Candidate's work,"There is no restriction on the amount of time candidates spend on exploring, creating and developing their performance/design from a published performance piece. **Candidate's work** must be submitted to WJEC within the final year of the course.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The possessive should be plural ('Candidates'') as it refers to the work of multiple candidates, consistent with 'candidates spend'."
8,4,under time,A: Anything that is **under time** may be self-penalising. Centres and learners should note that work which is significantly short is unlikely to be awarded in the higher mark bands as there may not be enough evidence of development and/or engagement with the audience.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,75,The phrasing 'under the minimum time' used later in the sentence is more precise and formal than 'under time'.
9,4,assessed will,"#### **Q: If the viva is not assessed will there be any penalty for a candidate who does not complete it?**

A: If a design candidate does not complete the Viva, this will be self-penalising and a missed opportunity to present their designs to the examiner.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,90,A comma is required after the introductory conditional clause 'If the viva is not assessed' to separate it from the main clause.
10,5,out of a choice of seven,"A: Unit 3 is no longer a paper examination, but a 2-hour on-screen examination. The exam will still look at one set text **out of a choice of seven**. Learners will also respond to live theatre as they do in the current specification.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,70,The phrase 'from a choice of seven' or 'one of seven options' would be more formal and concise.
11,5,which they have been entered for assessment,A: No. Candidates will sit the exam in the language **which they have been entered for assessment**.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,70,"While not strictly incorrect, 'that' is generally preferred for restrictive clauses, or the sentence could be rephrased for better flow, e.g., 'the language for which they have been entered for assessment'."
