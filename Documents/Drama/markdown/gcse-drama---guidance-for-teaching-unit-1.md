# <span id="page-6-0"></span>Overview of Unit 1

### <span id="page-6-1"></span>Devising Theatre

Practical non-examination assessment and Reflective Log Marked by centre and moderated by WJEC. 40% of qualification 96 marks

#### The purpose of this unit is to:

- develop an awareness and understanding of a range of theatrical practitioners/companies/styles and genres
- develop learners' awareness and skills regarding the creation and development of their own work
- develop learners' application of performance **or** design skills within a live performance
- provide an opportunity for learners to develop their ability to reflect, analyse and evaluate their creative decisions
- develop learners' resilience, determination and confidence.

#### This unit will focus on:

- **exploring** learners will have the opportunity to explore a range of theatrical practitioners/companies/styles and genres. This will include a range of techniques, forms, styles, contexts and means of presenting drama. Exploration could also be through the means of live and/or digital theatre, as possible sources of influence for performance or design ideas. Learners should have the opportunity to explore diversity, including different perspectives, identity, culture, and contributions that span Wales and the world.
- **responding and reflecting** learners will be able to reflect on their own work and respond to the feedback from others as an on-going process throughout the development period, allowing them to improve in the performances they give or in the designs they create
- **creating** learners will contribute to the creation of a devised performance in response to a choice of stimuli set by WJEC.

Learners may choose to complete this unit as actors **or** designers, regardless of their chosen pathway in Unit 2.

Learners choosing design must choose **one** of the following options:

- lighting design
- sound design
- set and props design
- costume, hair and make-up design.

#### For this assessment learners are required to:

- create and develop a piece of theatre in response to a stimulus, using either the techniques of an influential theatre practitioner, company or the characteristics of a theatrical style or genre and demonstrate and apply their performance **or** design skills in a live performance
- produce a reflective log.

Learners can choose to be assessed on either acting **or** design.

Learners can work in groups of between **two** and **five** actors. Each group may have up to **four** designers, each offering a different design skill.

{8}------------------------------------------------

The length of this piece of theatre will depend on the number of actors in the group and should be as follows:

• Group of two actors: 5-10 minutes • Group of three actors: 7-12 minutes • Group of four actors: 9-14 minutes • Group of five actors: 11-16 minutes.

Each actor must interact with other actors and/or the audience **for a minimum of five minutes**. The number of designers in a group does not impact on the length of the piece. Learners may complete the assessment anytime during the course. However, centres should ensure that assessment is completed only when learners have undertaken the necessary teaching and learning and developed the required skills and knowledge.

The assessment contributes to 40% of the overall qualification. The unit will be marked out of total of 96 marks.

<span id="page-7-0"></span>The stimuli will be released on WJEC's portal during the September of the first year of study. This unit will be assessed by the centre and externally moderated by WJEC.

| 1.1.1<br>Creating and<br>developing<br>ideas to<br>communicate<br>meaning | Learners should be able to:<br>• (following exploration of a range of<br>relevant<br>practitioners/companies/styles/genres)<br>create and develop ideas to<br>communicate meaning within a devised<br>performance.<br><br>Learners are required to:<br>• devise a performance in response to a<br>stimulus set by WJEC demonstrating<br>either the techniques of a theatre<br>practitioner/theatre company or the<br>dramatic conventions of a specific<br>theatrical style or genre. | Approaching Unit 1:<br>• Devising theatre gives learners the opportunity to use their imagination, explore and<br>push their creativity and create something unique that they should feel shared<br>ownership of.<br>• It can also be intimidating, frustrating and exposing. Devising theatre pushes learners<br>into uncharted territory and presents them with obstacles, dead ends and risk taking.<br>It requires teamwork, negotiation and taking responsibility. The devising process both<br>requires and develops a significant range of skills; subject-specific, personal and<br>interpersonal.<br>• Because most learners may not have had much experience of drama or performance<br>before their GCSE course, they need a toolkit of techniques and knowledge and<br>range of practical experiences to give them some reference points for their Unit 1<br>devising project.<br>• It is extremely important that learners are given the opportunity to explore a broad<br>range of drama in their Unit 1 preparation. The first year of a two-year GCSE course<br>offers the opportunity for learners to experience a diverse selection of styles,<br>practitioners, companies and genres from which they can then select their influence<br>for their Unit 1 project.<br>• Using the first year of the course to build the devising skills, techniques and styles is<br>also a significant way of allowing learners to develop self-confidence through<br>experience. In this way the learners can be allowed to become progressively more<br>independent in their decision making and creativity, with the teacher guiding them to<br>facilitate their ambition, encouraging resourcefulness and resilience. Additionally, this<br>progressive independence allows them to amass a range of work-related skills and<br>experiences. |

- There is no restriction on the amount of time learners spend on exploring, creating and developing their devised performance.
- Once the creating and developing work is underway, feedback must be limited to general advice on what needs to be improved. Teachers must not provide specific guidance on how to achieve these improvements.
- Teachers must see learners' ideas in progress at least three times at different stages during the process to be able to authenticate the work as the learner's own and complete the necessary authentication documentation.
- Teachers may provide guidance and support to learners to ensure that they have a clear understanding of the requirements, including the stimuli, the reflective log and the assessment grid.

#### **Preparing for Unit 1.**

#### **Introduction to devising – building confidence and skills:**

- Learners need to feel confident at risk-taking and need to feel comfortable to be able to develop ideas creatively through improvisation and collaborative experimentation.
- The value of building whole-group relationships and group trust in the early stages of the course cannot be underestimated. It is also worth considering gradually pushing learners out of their comfort zone through a series of confidence-developing workshops and activities as a prelude to the devising process.
- The table below contains some suggestions for areas that might be covered to prepare for the Unit 1 task. These are ideas only and are not a prescribed or exhaustive list.

- Learners need to understand what devising is and need to experience a range of devising strategies so that they can develop an understanding of a process to follow when they create their own pieces. All learners should be given the opportunity to experience a range of roles including actor, designer and director as they explore theatre. This will help them better consider each other's roles in the final project.
- They should have opportunities to learn about the reflective log and practice collating material and reflecting on their process and performance work through analysis and evaluation.
- To augment this, the more performance material learners can see, the better. It is important for learners to have experienced a range of material in different styles and forms so that they have a set of reference points they can use to inspire their own

{13}------------------------------------------------

- work and so that they can develop their understanding of how theatrical performance and design communicate meaning to an audience.
- Setting learners a series of mini projects where learners are taught about a style or practitioner and then work practically with that practitioner or style to produce a short workshop performance will give them a range of experiences and reference points that they can draw on for the three units in the GCSE course.
- Actors and designers can plan and present their ideas and should be given opportunities to show their work in a performance or workshop performance context.
- It is important that learners understand what devising is, but more importantly have several tools and strategies to draw on when they work. Below are some links that might be useful to help develop some strategies for learners to use:

#### **Ideas for exploring how to approach a stimulus – teaching ideas:**

• For examples of stimuli, please see the accompanying Assessment Pack (Page 7) [Portal by WJEC](https://portal.wjec.co.uk/?referrer=none)

#### **Possible task**

- Learners could be presented with a variety of different stimuli (quotation, song, statement, painting, photograph, object etc) as part of a carousel set up in the studio or classroom. These stimuli could be selected to subtly elicit connections with some cross-cutting themes for example, sustainability, human rights and diversity, relationships and sexuality, local, national or international contexts.
- In a small group or pairs, spend 10 minutes with each stimulus and need to answer the following questions:
- **Where, when, who, what (is happening/has happened), why?**
- Answers need to contain **detail** for example, "in North Wales" is not enough for "where?". Something more like, "outside the Bangor Road Co-op in Penmaenmawr," would be much more specific and will open up many more possibilities.
- In a plenary, groups can be asked for their responses. The teacher could push for more in-depth answers and pursue a learner's idea to model how it could be developed.

{15}------------------------------------------------

#### **Developing their idea more:**

#### **Possible task**

- 1. List themes or issues that their ideas have raised for their favourite storyline
- 2. Use one or two of these themes develop the idea further
- 3. Consider the characters in the idea
- 4. Use a simple chart using adjectives to help define the characters. Learners should aim to choose adjectives that describe the personality of their characters

| NAME | AGE | ADJECTIVE<br>1 | ADJECTIVE<br>2 | ADJECTIVE<br>3 | LINK TO<br>OTHER<br>CHARACTERS |

|      |     |                |                |                |                                |
|      |     |                |                |                |                                |

#### **Make the work three-dimensional:**

#### **Possible task**

Use freezeframes to show key moments from the story, or to show relationships between characters. These could come to life for 30 seconds, moving the work forwards through improvisation. The link below explores using tableaux and freezeframes in devising.

#### **Creating the final exam piece:**

• Essentially the task consists of five stages - development of ideas, building the piece, refining the piece, performing and reflecting on the process and performance.

#### **Grouping learners:**

• Careful consideration should be given to grouping learners for Unit 1. Some centres will decide the groups, others may discuss learner's preferences for a particular style or practitioner to help with grouping decisions. Some learners might welcome the opportunity to be able to nominate two other learners that they might like to work with, and to rank their stylistic preferences. Ultimately, the teacher knows their class best and will make the final call.

{19}------------------------------------------------

#### **Design candidates:**

- The design options available to learners will be influenced by the centre's ability to resource the learners choosing either set and props, lighting, sound or costume, hair and make-up design. It is important that design candidates experience the same depth and range of experiences as acting candidates. They are an integral part of the Unit 1 group and should work closely with the actors in planning, developing and refining their designs as the piece evolves. Elements of design ideally will begin to be used and experimented with by the groups as the work develops; costume measurements, hair and make-up try-outs early will inform refinement decisions, as will experiments with set and props during rehearsals. Lighting designers might need to adapt the intensity or positioning of lanterns as changes are made by the actors; sound designers need to experiment with sound choices, volumes and placing their sound in conjunction with the actors.
- It is important to try to ensure that designers avoid a highly pressured final week; this can easily occur if the performers keep making modifications and alterations beyond a cut-off. This needs to be a point, agreed in advance, after which the changes should not be allowed to alter the design work significantly.

There are minimum requirements for the realisation of each design option:

#### **Lighting design:**

- 6 different states
- learners must operate the lighting board in the performance
- cue sheets.

#### **Sound design:**

- 6 different cues
- learners must operate the sound desk in the performance
- cue sheets.

{20}------------------------------------------------

#### **Set design and props design:**

- set and props created and/or dressed for performance of 1 group
- learners must arrange the props table/set up performance space prior to the performance and provide a model set. The model may be presented in a digital format.

#### **Costume design, hair and make-up design:**

- 1 full costume, hair and make-up for 2 different characters (two costume, hair and make-up designs in total)
- sketches of both costume, hair and make-up designs.

#### **Group sizes:**

- Each centre should consider its own context and learners when deciding on group sizes. The final performances should aim to be within the timing range stipulated. Teachers should consider how effectively their learners will be able to sustain performance in larger groups producing longer pieces.
- There can be between 2 and 5 actors in a performance group. Each performance group can have up to 4 designers, with each designer offering a different design skill.

#### **Timings**

- Group of two actors: 5-10 minutes
- Group of three actors: 7-12 minutes
- Group of four actors: 9-14 minutes
- Group of five actors: 11-16 minutes.
- The number of designers does not affect the performance timings. For example, a performance by a group with two actors and four designers should last between 5-10 minutes.
- Each actor must interact with other actors and/or the audience for a minimum of five minutes.

#### **Selecting the stimulus:**

{21}------------------------------------------------

- Learners should be given the opportunity to explore each of the stimuli. It might be useful to give learners a handout with all the stimuli as well as printed song lyrics (if there is a song in the stimuli) that they can read while the song is played This might mean one lesson is allocated to each stimulus.
- This is productive as it not only gives learners the opportunity to explore the range of stimuli, but it also generates discussion and ideas which may be returned to even if a different stimulus is chosen.
- Using notes from their exploration of different styles, practitioners, genres and companies carried out earlier in the course, learners might find it useful to create a checklist of key features and devices that they consider using in their work. This will help them to ensure that their work contains a variety of techniques, conventions and devices appropriate to their chosen practitioner, style, company or genre.

#### **Selecting style, practitioner, genre or company:**

• It is preferable if learners can input into this selection themselves, with some guidance, basing their preference on what they have learned or experienced over the course, where they feel their strengths lie and the individuals within the group.

#### **Considerations when selecting the influence:**

- The performance and design needs to clearly recognisable features of the chosen practitioner, company, style or genre. Centres should explore a range of these in adequate detail to give learners enough information and experience to be able to knowledgeably create work that effectively demonstrates their choice of working method.
- Design candidates do not have to be tied to the same choice as the acting candidates. For example, a devised piece might have actors working in a naturalistic style with naturalistic costuming, but the set and prop design could be symbolic or expressionistic if it worked effectively within the concept of the piece. It is anticipated that learners would go on to analyse and evaluate their artistic decision regarding this stylistic choice within the reflective log.
- Practitioners, styles, genres and theatre companies should be recognised and known. The theatre company does not need to be currently operating. If you have any concerns about the suitability of a practitioner, company, style or genre, please contact WJEC before committing.

There are, of course, many available practitioners and styles that centres could choose to work with. Within the GCSE Drama Delivery Guide (Appendix A), teachers will find a list of Theatre Practitioners and Genres which can be used to develop learner's work.

{27}------------------------------------------------

#### **Other styles and practitioners that centres could consider might include:**

- Theatre of Cruelty
- Artaud
- Total Theatre
- Steven Berkoff
- Theatre of the Oppressed
- Augusto Boal
- Kitchen Sink Drama
- Verbatim
- Emma Rice
- Katie Mitchell.

#### **Styles designers might consider:**

- Naturalistic
- Non-naturalistic
- Epic/Brechtian
- Expressionistic
- Minimalistic
- Symbolic
- Realism.

#### **Genres:**

Learners might choose to work with a genre. Often, combining a genre with a style or practitioner will help add structure and form to the devised work.

Possible choices might include:

- Comedy
- Tragedy
- Tragicomedy
- Farce
- Melodrama
- Satire.

{28}------------------------------------------------

#### **Theatre Companies:**

- Modern theatre mixes styles and techniques, and most theatre companies have their own "house style". It is often difficult to categorise theatre companies by style or practitioner because of this merging of influences.
- Devising a piece in the style of a theatre company can be exciting and highly rewarding; centres are reminded of the importance of ensuring that learners have an adequate understanding of the company and its work.
- The devised pieces need to clearly use features of the company's style and approach, which will need to be analysed and evaluated in the reflective log.
- Some suggestions for companies follow. A number of the companies work with a clearly recognisable practitioner or style; the work of others is more hybrid.
- These are just some ideas, and by no means should be seen as a prescriptive or exclusive list.

#### **Devising task:**

• It might be helpful to task learners with compiling a list of "ingredients" that might be expected in a devised piece that works within the conventions or techniques of a particular genre, style, company or practitioner if it is not in the table above. This will give them a useful checklist for their devising and will also enable the teacher to check that the learners understand what needs to be evident in their work.

#### **Maintaining momentum:**

- Centres may choose to incorporate several interim deadlines in their devising process. These might set a date for the formal end of research and ideas development; a date by when a complete "rough draft" of the work is to be finished and a date by when the refinement period should be complete. Incorporated into this schedule, it might be useful to include a number of short workshop performances or showings of the work.
- A questionnaire for the audience will assist refinement of the piece. Designers should aim to include elements of their design work in these showcases. These deadlines will help learners and teachers avoid feeling highly pressured towards the end of the process as the performance date nears.

#### **Rehearsal notes:**

- Keeping notes from rehearsals that are focussed on key areas relevant to the reflective log will allow learners to collate information as their work progresses. The can then select key information from their notes for their reflective log at the end of the process.
- These notes could include, for example, a brief summary of a technique used, how, why and how it was successful. The notebook is the ideal place for learners to cite their research sources, include mind maps, sketches, script extracts. Ultimately, the notebook will provide much of the content of the Reflective Log. The centre might opt to design a pre-formatted booklet or online document that learners can use.

{31}------------------------------------------------

• Along with this, or alternatively, centres may include reflective log writing sessions along with their interim deadlines, allowing learners to produce the log as an ongoing document.

# 1.1.2

Developing and applying performance **or** design skills within a live performance

#### Learners are required to:

• develop and apply their performance or design skills within a live performance

#### Learners should be able to: (performance)

- demonstrate their ability to apply performance skills in relation to their chosen practitioner/company's theatrical aims or their chosen style/genre's conventions
- communicate their interpretation of character(s) and sustain audience engagement
- contribute to the performance

#### (designers)

- demonstrate their ability to apply design skills in relation to their chosen practitioner/company's theatrical aims or their chosen style/genre's conventions, as relevant to their chosen design option
- communicate their interpretation of the extract(s) and sustain audience engagement
- ensure their design contributes to the performance.

#### **Performing:**

- It is ideal if the exam itself has a sense of occasion and an audience. Hopefully the learners will be well-rehearsed, confident in their work and in themselves. The audience might be a small number of people invited by the performers, their own class or the drama class from the year below.
- If TIE is chosen as a style, a primary class or year 7 group may be the audience. Some centres may also wish to get their learners to perform their work to a wider audience a short time before their real exam. This can be very useful as it provides a genuine performance environment for the learners and may make them feel more confident and in control of their examination performance, although not all candidates may want to show their work to their family or parents and centres should consider the extra pressure that this may place on their learners.

#### **General guidelines to aid the exam:**

- The performances must be recorded, stored and uploaded for moderation.
- The camera should be set up on a tripod providing a clear view of the whole stage. It should be positioned close enough to allow the details of the performance to be clearly seen by the moderator. Test the camera before the performance to ensure everything is working properly, especially the sound and the focus.
- If a group has opted to use a promenade staging, then it is perfectly acceptable for the camera to follow the work, however, please be mindful that the work will be required for moderation and will need to clearly justify the marks awarded by the centre.
- Each group's introduction and performance should be recorded as one continuous take. It is useful to get learners to rehearse their introductions during the rehearsal process, and it is perfectly reasonable to let them use a prompt card with their information written on it to avoid the introduction turning into the most stressful part of the exam.
- If during the performance, candidates forget lines and there is a pause, this must not

{34}------------------------------------------------

be edited out.

• To ensure consistency for all groups and to aid the smooth filming of the exam, it might be useful after the introduction for the teacher to ask the group to get to their starting positions, call for a blackout when they are ready and count down "3,2,1" to start the performance and set the timer running.

#### **Using the recording for the Reflective log:**

• Learners need to watch back their performances as soon after the exam as possible. Centres should consider how this might be facilitated. Learners might be given access to watch the recording by group once it has been placed on the centre's system; alternatively, if a centre's policy permits, learners might ask a member of the audience to film their group's performance which can then be shared with the group quickly. Obviously, centres need to consider that this is exam work and must only be seen and used by the individual learners for the purpose of their logs and should not be shared publicly under any circumstances.

#### **Blackouts, scene changes and timing:**

- Over-long blackouts should be avoided and should not count towards the overall running time of the performance. What happens in the blackout should be rehearsed thoroughly as part of the preparation process to identify issues and ensure that transitions in blackout can be smooth and efficient.
- If a detailed set change is required, it may not be practical to do this in complete darkness; in this case it is perfectly acceptable for the scene to end with a blackout, then a dim working light (blue flood) can fade up to allow the set designer to alter the set as required. Working lights will fade out and the next scene will commence.
- A costume designer might need to alter a costume on a character or change their makeup, or a lighting designer might need to change a gel in a sidelight mid performance. Again, it is perfectly acceptable for this to happen under working lights to allow the design to be realised effectively.
- However, the timer should be paused for this to take place and restarted when the performance continues.

{35}------------------------------------------------

#### **Design candidates:**

- Design candidates need to be present. They should introduce themselves at the start of the performance along with the acting candidates, including their name, candidate number and design option.
- Sound and lighting candidates must operate the sound or lighting boards in the performance.
- As stated above, they can alter or adapt their design work , as appropriate, during the performance.

#### **Unforeseen circumstances:**

- Hopefully the exam will be an exciting and rewarding day and a celebration of lots of hard work. However, sometimes unforeseen circumstances occur that interrupt the performance, such as a fire alarm. If this happens, the performance needs to stop.
- It is important to make sure that all learners have the same fair and equal experience on exam day. When the interruption has passed, the affected group should recommence their performance *from the point where it was interrupted*, *and filming should restart at that point.*
- When submitting the video for moderation, it would comprise two parts.
- It would not be appropriate to let one group restart and have a second run when all the other groups did not have this option. In the event of any such unforeseen circumstances, please notify WJEC.
- Important points for consideration include individual performance time and work that is significantly under-length.
- Of course, within a performance, actors might exit and then re-enter for a different scene; some actors may not be present in all scenes. On the other hand, some performances might be ensemble work with all performers interacting together for a sustained period.

{36}------------------------------------------------

- In order to access all mark bands, each actor should be interacting in the space for a minimum of five minutes.
- In situations where a learner is interacting for fewer than 5 minutes, careful consideration should be given to where the candidate's marks are placed. If a candidate is significantly below the 5-minute threshold, for example, they are performing for two minutes or less, the marks awarded are likely to be in the lower bands.
- If a group performance is within the timing range, it does not automatically follow that all performers are able to access all mark bands. For example, if one actor is only on stage and interacting for 2 minutes, then this must be considered when assessing the learners.

#### **Examples of timing scenarios:**

#### **Work that is longer than the maximum time limit:**

- Teachers should remind groups that their work has a maximum time limit. During the development and rehearsal of the work, learners should be encouraged to time their pieces, and during the refinement process, the work needs to be trimmed to length if it risks being over-long.
- There is no penalty for work that exceeds the time limit, however, only work up to the maximum time should be assessed. Moderators will not look at work after the maximum time has been reached and consequently only work up to the maximum time will be taken into consideration during moderation.

{38}------------------------------------------------

- The timings are designed to allow the process to be manageable for centres and accessible to learners. Rather than striving to create long pieces, learners might consider as an alternative adding depth and refining their work through further detailed application of practitioner or stylistic features.
- Particularly with naturalistic styled work, ideas with very complex plotlines can be difficult to realise successfully within a short performance time. Learners could consider whether focussing in on a particular moment or relationship within a complex plot line might allow for more detailed characterisation and more sustained interaction for their devised performance.

#### **The performance needs to allow learners to:** (actors)

- demonstrate their ability to apply performance skills in relation to their chosen practitioner/company's theatrical aims or their chosen style/genre's conventions
- communicate their interpretation of character(s) and sustain audience engagement
- contribute to the performance.

#### (designers)

- demonstrate their ability to apply design skills in relation to their chosen practitioner/company's theatrical aims or their chosen style/genre's conventions, as relevant to their chosen design option
- communicate their interpretation of the extract(s) and sustain audience engagement
- ensure their design contributes to the performance.

#### **Examples of how these may be shown could include: Actors**

#### **Designers:**

• In the same way that lighting and sound design will consist of a series of different states and cues, set and prop designers and costume, hair and make-up designers could consider how their design might develop or change during the performance.

#### 1.1.3 Reflecting on their own work

#### Learners should be able to:

- reflect on, analyse and evaluate their own work
- critically evaluate the effectiveness and impact of their creative choices linked to their:
  - response to their chosen stimulus
  - choice of practitioner/company/style/genre
  - application of performance or design skills.

#### **The Reflective Log**

- The reflective log gives learners the opportunity to analyse and evaluate their work in both the process and the final performance of UNIT1. There is no prescribed format for the reflective log, allowing learners to present their information in a format that best suits them as individuals.
- It is important to consider the manageability of the format chosen to ensure that learners can communicate effectively through their chosen format and that the technological requirements of the format can be met. This is particularly pertinent to formats using video.
- Centres should be mindful of the requirement to upload the reflective logs for moderation and should be satisfied that this can be achieved as efficiently and smoothly as possible from the centre's perspective, to avoid taking up unnecessarily large amounts of time.
- Design candidates must, in their log, include evidence of their final design, as appropriate to their chosen skill, which could include the following: [WJEC Drama](https://www.wjec.co.uk/media/owslmy2o/wjec-gcse-drama-specification.pdf)  [Specification.](https://www.wjec.co.uk/media/owslmy2o/wjec-gcse-drama-specification.pdf)

#### **Lighting design:**

- cue sheets
- lighting plot
- mood board

#### **Sound design:**

- cue sheets
- sound plot
- mood board

#### **Set and props design:**

- set model
- ground plan
- photographs of set and props tables

{42}------------------------------------------------

#### **Costume, hair and make-up design:**

- final design sketches
- photographs of the designs in performance (could be taken during dress rehearsals)
- mood board.

#### **Possible formats might include (this is not an exhaustive list):**

- A typed or written document. This may include appendices and/or illustrative material.
- A PowerPoint (or similar) presentation with either audio or a transcript
- A filmed PowerPoint (or similar) presentation.
- An audio recording
- A video talk to camera
- A series of vlogs of key moments with a voiceover/commentary
- An audio or video in an interview format
- It is important to ensure that the format or formats chosen for the creative log will be manageable in terms of time, resources and logistics. Centres might wish to consider:

#### **How detailed might the log need to be?**

• Every learner will find a different level of challenge in producing the reflective log and therefore centres need to consider their own specific contexts and learners. Essentially, the log asks for learners to reflect on three areas through analysis and evaluation.

#### For **acting** candidates:

- why the stimulus was chosen and how it influenced the final performance.
- how the chosen practitioner/company's artistic aims or the chosen style/genre's performance conventions were incorporated into their final performance.
- how the learner's own performance skills contributed to the effectiveness of the final performance.

#### For **design** candidates:

• why the stimulus was chosen and how it influenced the final design.

{43}------------------------------------------------

- how their chosen practitioner/company's artistic aims or their chosen style/genre's design conventions were incorporated into the final design.
- how their own design skills contributed to the effectiveness of the final performance.
- During a learner's reflection, they are invited to talk about *what* they did, *how*, *why* and *why it was successful (or not).*
- When assessing the log, it is important not to equate the number of points made with marks, but to use the mark scheme to assess the log holistically and place the work in the appropriate band.
- Teachers and learners should consider the following:
  - is the log as a whole: detailed; competent; basic; limited; or does it contain no analysis or evaluation?
  - Are all the three areas covered?
  - Is there a range of examples and how detailed is the level of analysis and evaluation?
- A detailed log might cover breadth and depth very effectively, reflecting on each of the three areas with a number of examples and detailed analysis and evaluation, or may identify a smaller number of examples but with very detailed analysis and evaluation.
- A basic log might cover all three areas with some examples and some basic analysis and evaluation. There may be unequal level of detail across the three areas.

#### **Length of Reflective Log**

- Video or audio there is no specific guidance given as to the length of this, but in order to ensure all aspects are considered, it would likely be within the 3 – 7 minutes window.
- Written there is no specific guidance given as to the length of this, but it would likely be fewer than 800 words.
- Consideration should be given to how much lesson time is allocated to the reflective log. For example, will learners be given guidance and advice in class and be expected to produce the log independently or will time be allocated to producing the

{44}------------------------------------------------

log in lesson time.

#### **When to produce the reflective log.**

- It is good practice to make sure that learners know what the reflective log is and what it needs to contain before they begin the devising project. As the work develops, they could be given opportunities to pause and to reflect on their progress, skills and techniques used. These reflective moments will provide content for the final log.
- Centres may decide that learners will produce sections of the log as they go; alternatively, some centres may decide that learners will collate material during the process, and, after the performance will be able to select material, they wish to include in their final log.
- When, how and where the video or audio logs are recorded should be carefully considered. Learners may have access to a separate space for recording during a lesson or, it might be appropriate to organise lunchtime or after school recordings.

#### **Considerations for possible Reflective Log formats:**

- A typed or written document. This may include appendices and/or illustrative material.
- This document could be typed or hand-written. It could be divided into sub-headed sections. It might contain illustrative material, perhaps photos of rehearsal and/or performance, extracts of the devising script showing modifications over time, design sketches and/or photos; extracts from research; links, websites and citations.
- It is important that the document contains clear analysis and evaluation which should be overt rather than implicit. For example, consideration should be given as to whether a series of images of rehearsal demonstrates analysis and evaluation, or whether it simply documents the process.

#### **A PowerPoint (or similar) presentation with either audio or a transcript**

• If learners choose to use presentation applications, e.g. PowerPoint, it is important to consider the need for the presentation to contain clear analysis and evaluation. For moderation purposes a simple PowerPoint (or prints of slides) may not contain sufficient analysis and evaluation without a transcript of the presentation given. The PowerPoint could be voiced.

{45}------------------------------------------------

#### **A filmed PowerPoint (or similar) presentation.**

• If this format is used, centres should be mindful of the need to ensure that the video clearly shows the slides used and that the candidate is clearly audible. Centres may choose to upload the PowerPoint along with the video of the learner.

#### **An audio recording**

• This could take the form of a recorded speech. Alternatively, candidates might choose to compile a series of short recordings during the process and after the performance. It is important that these audio recordings contain analysis and evaluation. Some learners might want to record on their phones or devices; centres will need to consider whether this is acceptable or appropriate within their own contexts. It is important to consider how these recordings are stored, whether there is a risk of them being deleted and how they will be uploaded/transferred.

#### **A video talk to camera**

- This might be in the form of a learner talking directly to camera. The style may be formal or relatively informal but appropriate for the task and audience. Learners may use supporting materials for example they could read short extracts of script or play brief extracts of their performance on a laptop or phone to the camera.
- Some learners may want to edit their talk and use video effects; the manageability of the format should be considered, and teachers and learners should be mindful of how much time might be taken for this process. Some learners might want to record on their phones or devices; centres will need to consider whether this is acceptable or appropriate within their own contexts. It is important to consider how these recordings are stored, whether there is a risk of them being deleted and how they will be uploaded/transferred.

#### **A series of vlogs of key moments with a voiceover/commentary**

• Learners may choose to record a series of short videos or vlogs over the duration of the devising project. It is important that these videos contain analysis and evaluation. The style may be formal or relatively informal but appropriate for the task and audience. Learners may use supporting materials for example they could read short extracts of script or play brief extracts of their performance on a laptop or phone to the camera.

{46}------------------------------------------------

• Some learners may want to edit their talk and use video effects and edit in video clips of work; the manageability of the format should be considered, and teachers and learners should be mindful of how much time might be taken for this process. Some learners might want to record on their phones or devices; centres will need to consider whether this is acceptable or appropriate within their own contexts. It is important to consider how these recordings are stored, whether there is a risk of them being deleted and how they will be uploaded/transferred.

#### **An audio or video in an interview or conversation format**

• This might take the form of a recorded conversation/interview style of reflective log. A teacher might choose to sit with a learner and ask them questions about their process and performance. The style could be reasonably formal (interview) or more informal (conversation). Learners might use notes in this.

#### **Examples of how learners might link process and performance in their reflective logs.**

• Within the reflective log there needs to analysis and evaluation of both process and performance. Below are some possible ways in which this might be done for learners following acting and design pathways:

#### **Authentication of the Reflective Log:**

- Teachers may provide guidance and support to learners to ensure that they have a clear understanding of the requirements, including the stimuli, the reflective log and the assessment grid.
- Teachers must also see at least one draft of the reflective log but must not provide any written feedback before the final submission. Feedback must be limited to general advice and teachers must not provide specific guidance on how to improve the work. The teacher must sign the authentication document to authenticate the reflective log as the learner's own work.

Once the reflective log has been submitted to the teacher to assess, no further amendments may be made. Please see accompanying Assessment pack for more information. [Portal by WJEC](https://portal.wjec.co.uk/?referrer=none)

- Sharing longer workshop moments with another group midprocess.
- Using refinement to develop and add detail and sophistication to their performance or design work as the receive feedback and reflect on their skills.
- *1.1.3 reflecting on their own work.*
- Learners should be encouraged to review and evaluate their work and the work of others on a regular basis. This may take the form of a quick justified comment, using a tick list, watching recordings of their own workshop performances and mini projects and analysing and evaluating the effectiveness of the piece's communication of meaning or their own or others' performances, either informally through discussion or in written form, practising the skills required for the reflective log.

- *1.1.1 creating and developing ideas to communicate meaning.*
- *1.1.2 developing and applying performance or design skills within a live performance.*
- *1.1.3 reflecting on their own work.*
- Learners could consider the appropriacy of their content and be guided by the centre, particularly if they wish to explore sensitive issues. Learners need to be encouraged to produce work that is ambitious and thought provoking but need to consider where the line is. Teaching information about, for example, the protected characteristics as part of the exploration process might be an interesting area for discussion and will help learners inform their decisions.

#### **Examples of how this might be approached:**

- Learners could be given a practice devising task to create and develop a TIE piece using a stimulus related to sustainability.
- All learners could opt for digital options when making notes, planning, mind mapping their ideas.
- Designers could work with more sustainable approaches, for example set and props designers could choose to repurpose, recycle and reuse in their approach to their designs.
- Costume, hair and make-up designers could consider more sustainable sources for their costumes – charity shops, eBay, repurpose, reuse, recycle, upcycle, alterations, etc.
- Lighting designers could consider and calculate the energy consumption of lanterns, exploring alternative innovative methods of lighting their work, for example, mobile phones; led lanterns; led candles, etc. They could then use their findings to influence their design decisions.

them individual responsibilities and accountability, for example, each person has a responsibility to incorporate one practitioner technique into the drama. Each rehearsal session might require them to produce in advance a list of objectives for the rehearsal, with each session having a five-minute plenary to discuss its efficacy as a team.

- In addition to learning about, for example, technical skills or acting skills, learners could learn about or research into job roles within theatre. Learners could be given or create a brief job description, outlining their role and responsibilities within the project. This experience could be enhanced with a tour of a local theatre, or a Q & A session with someone from the industry.
- Learners might consider health and safety guidance, for example when creating work that involves levels or hazards. Designers might audit their working practice to identify health and safety hazards, e.g., working at height, slip/trip hazards; use of liquids on stage; safe positioning of electrical equipment/lanterns; use of safety chains; safety in blackouts.

#### **Cross-curricular Skills - Digital Competence** Citizenship **There are many opportunities to include Digital Competence in GCSE Drama. These opportunities are important to Learners because it allows digital enhancement to support the creation of new work, thus maintaining relevance within this ever-changing contemporary landscape. Below are some examples of how Digital Competence can be embedded into teaching and learning:** *Specification Reference Amplification Example 1.1.1 1.1.2 1.1.3 Creating and developing ideas to communicate meaning Developing and applying performance or design skills within a live performance Reflecting on their own work* • Being a conscientious digital citizen will be an important consideration for learners in the devising process. Using digital material and resources judiciously and safely to research and develop creative ideas is a key part of the process. Being aware of online safety and etiquette would be a consideration if learners were contacting a theatre company or communicating with any outside sources. • Thinking about when to use digital technology and how it can contribute positively to the project will be important when working with styles that require visual elements to augment the performance. Considering laws about plagiarism and copyright and illegal downloading need to be considered when selecting, for example, audio and video material. **Examples of how this might be approached:** • Learners may manage digital files and folders, both independently and collaboratively, during the devising process and sharing of resources - a group may use a

{74}------------------------------------------------

group chat or shared script development document and will need to work using appropriate digital etiquette. • Learners are able to plan their digital work during the rehearsal process and search a variety of sources when constructing narrative and exploring design concepts. They could compile a list of sources in their rehearsal diaries to use in their Reflective Logs. • Learners might explore using multimedia in their devised work and would need to consider the benefits and limitations of a range of digital tools for their purpose which might feature in their reflective log. • Presentation of digital material at the end of the process when realising acting and design in performance, facilitates the refinement of digital work based on reflection. This is also true of the Reflective Log if constructed digitally.

Effective performances require learners to develop and demonstrate control of a range of skills and an application of knowledge. The development of the pieces for final performance, using amendment and refinement skills, lends itself to critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Overcoming problems encountered in the rehearsal period will require learners to demonstrate critical thinking and problem-solving skills.<br><br>Examples of how this might be approached:<br>• Creating and developing effective transitions to link disjointed key scenes would encourage individual and group problem-solving skills.<br>• Identifying why a particular sound effect does not combine effectively with a particular moment in a piece of theatre would require sophisticated critical thinking and problem-solving skills.<br>• Setting a prop design task for a special effects prop would encourage problem solving skills in a practical context.<br>• Analysing and evaluating a performance or rehearsal moment that is particularly powerful requires critical thinking skills. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| There are many opportunities to include Planning and Organisation in GCSE Drama. These opportunities are important to Learners because it is imperative that the study of theatre craft is holistic, thus ensuring that the work of those behind the scenes is as appreciated as the those who embody the final performance product. Below are some examples of how Planning and Organisation can be embedded into teaching and learning: |                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Learners become increasingly independent from the teacher as Unit 1 evolves to performance, with the development of planning and organisation skills a key factor to support this process. The nature of group arrangements, expectations and interactions enable learners to develop an understanding of emotions, behaviours and social influences, skills essential to building strong relationships to achieve goals. |

**There are many opportunities to include Personal Effectiveness in GCSE Drama. These opportunities are important to Learners because it allows them to consider their individual contribution to the final outcomes, thus catalysing personal evolution and growth that benefits all of those they work with. Below are some examples of how Personal Effectiveness can be embedded into teaching and learning:** *Specification Reference Amplification Example*

# Personal Effectiveness

*1.1.1*

*1.1.2*

*1.1.3*

# *Creating and developing ideas to communicate meaning Developing and applying performance or design skills within a live performance Reflecting on their own*

*work*

• Becoming confident and independent in employing this material and converting it into theatre is a strong feature of UNIT1 which helps learners to become enterprising, resourceful and resilient, to work as a team and be reliable contributors. Through research and communication of meaning, they are able to develop an understanding of the world around them leading to purposeful outcomes. The content of Unit 1 enables learners to make considered, informed decisions, reflecting over and justifying their choices. Skills in self-evaluation, resilience and reflection are accessed during the compilation of the Reflective Log.

#### **Examples of how this might be approached:**

- Setting a personal, dated schedule for learning lines.
- Developing resilience and focus through persistent rehearsal of a chair-duet sequence.
- Downloading a lighting desk manual and autonomously learning how to programme a chase sequence.
- Planning an efficient and time-saving timeline for the costume design process.
