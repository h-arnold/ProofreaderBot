# Information for Teachers

This pack contains information about the assessment materials for Unit 1: Devising Theatre.

Within this pack, you will find:

- information for teachers on how to manage arrangements for assessment
- information which must be shared with candidates which tells them about things that they must and must not do when they are completing the assessment
- the mark scheme which must be used to assess candidate work.

## Managing the assessment

This is a centre-marked (internal) non-examination assessment. The following arrangements must be followed when managing and marking the assessment.

### Resources

Candidates must have access to the NEA brief (released on Portal on September 1st each year), the information for candidates contained within this handbook and any necessary resources.

### Collaboration

Learners may choose **either** acting **or** design.

Learners work in groups of between **two** and **five** actors to devise a piece of theatre. Each group may have up to **four** designers, each offering a different design skill. Learners must reflect individually on the process of creating and developing their own piece of theatre and on the realisation of their performance **or** design.

All learners must contribute fully to the development and creation of the piece of theatre. Devised pieces must therefore be carefully developed to ensure that all learners are able to fully demonstrate their chosen skill.

Centres should also ensure safe working practices for all learners.

Designers may select a different theatre practitioner/company/style/genre to the actors in their group.

### Supervision

- No formal supervision.
- There is no restriction on the amount of time learners spend on exploring, creating and developing their devised performance.
- Teachers may provide guidance and support to learners to ensure that they have a clear understanding of the requirements, including the stimuli, the reflective log and the assessment grid.
- Once the creating and developing work is underway, feedback must be limited to general advice on what needs to be improved. Teachers must **not** provide specific guidance on how to achieve these improvements.
- Teachers must see learners' ideas in progress at least three times at different stages during the process to be able to authenticate the work as the learner's own and complete the necessary authentication documentation.

{5}------------------------------------------------

- Teachers must also see at least one draft of the reflective log but must not provide any written feedback before the final submission. Feedback must be limited to general advice and teachers must not provide specific guidance on how to improve the work.
- Teachers must sign the authentication document to authenticate the reflective log as the learner's own work.
- Once the reflective log has been submitted to the teacher to assess, no further amendments may be made.

### Authentication

Candidates can review and redraft evidence independently.

Candidates must sign the declaration to confirm that all evidence submitted for assessment is their own work and that any sources used have been acknowledged.

Assessors must sign the declaration to confirm that evidence submitted for assessment was completed under the conditions set out in this assessment.

### Weighting:

There are 96 marks awarded in Unit 1 Unit 1 makes up 40% of the GCSE Drama qualification.

### Administration

Centres are reminded that the following documentation should be completed for Unit 1:

- Unit 1 Centre Approval Form
- Unit 1 Marksheet and Declaration Form
- Unit 1 Programme Proforma

All information regarding the submission of these forms can be found in our [E-Submission](https://www.wjec.co.uk/home/administration/e-submission-upload/#tab_0)  [Subject Guide \(IAMIS\).](https://www.wjec.co.uk/home/administration/e-submission-upload/#tab_0)

{6}------------------------------------------------

### Candidate evidence

### Performance

The assessor **must** be present for all performances so that the work can be authenticated.

All performances must be audio-visually recorded by the centre and submitted to WJEC via IAMIS.

All learners (including designers) must be clearly identified by name and candidate number at the start of each group performance.

The recording must be of all the performances which have been assessed live by the assessor.

The recording of each piece must be the complete, unedited performance filmed from the audience perspective.

### Reflective Log

There is no prescribed format regarding the presentation of the reflective log.

Learners can choose to submit the task in any of the formats noted below (or any other suitable format):

- audio presentation
- audio visual presentation
- PowerPoint
- written prose.

### Marking the assessment

The marking schemes for this assessment are included in Section 3 of this handbook.

All evidence must be assessed against the marking criteria provided. Evidence marked must comply with any requirements set out in this handbook.

Written evidence must be annotated to show how it relates to the mark band requirements.

Candidate marksheets must include a description of learner performance as well as a summative statement on the quality of that performance.

Marking should only be undertaken by a designated assessor. An assessor should have appropriate expertise in the subject and level for a specified unit. The assessor is responsible for ensuring that:

- assessment is conducted under the controls specified in this unit
- they are clear about the requirements of the assessment and marking scheme prior to commencing assessment
- evidence presented for assessment is valid, authentic, reliable and credible
- assessment decisions are accurately recorded
- evidence is appropriately annotated
- judgements are only made against the mark band statements.

A mark record sheet must be completed for each candidate. These are stored on the subject page of the website under NEA.

{7}------------------------------------------------

### Further information

You should refer to the JCQ Instructions for conducting non-examination assessment for further information on managing assessment within our GCSE/Applied Qualifications.

# Assessment

The assessment brief is available on WJEC Portal under Non-Examination Assessment Tasks.

The total mark for this unit is 96.

Assessment may be undertaken at any time during the qualification. However, centres should ensure that assessment is completed only when learners have undertaken the necessary teaching and learning and developed the required skills and knowledge.

Work which falls under the time limit will not be penalised. However, centres and learners should note that work which is significantly short is unlikely to be awarded in the higher mark bands as there may not be enough evidence of development and/or engagement with the audience.

Work which exceeds the time limit will not be penalised. However, centres and learners should note that only work which falls within the maximum timings specified on page 1 should be assessed. The assessor must not award marks once the maximum performance time has passed.

The moderator will stop watching a performance after the maximum time has been reached and will only consider work viewed up to this point.

The unit will be internally assessed and externally moderated by WJEC.

There is no specified word count for the Reflective Log.

### Guidance for Assessment

## Task 1 - Create and develop a piece of theatre

There are assessment grids for the different options available. Assessors should use the correct grid for the option chosen by the candidate:

- performance
- lighting design
- sound design
- set and props design
- costume, hair and make-up design.

There are 4 columns in each grid.

Column 1 within each grid assesses AO4:

• learners' ability to create and develop ideas to communicate meaning.

{8}------------------------------------------------

Columns 2, 3 and 4 in each grid assess AO2:

- application of performance **or** design skills
- interpretation of character(s) **or** extract(s) and audience engagement
- contribution to the performance.

The appropriate band should be established by determining which performance descriptor best reflects the learner's performance.

The appropriate mark should then be established by determining the extent to which the learners has met the criteria within the relevant band – completely met (upper part of band), mostly met (middle of band), partially met (lower part of band).

The total marks for all 4 columns may reflect performance at different bands across the assessment objectives, for example, a learner may achieve band 4 for column 1 and band 5 for column 2.

{9}------------------------------------------------

### Column 1 – Creating and developing ideas (AO4)

When assessing AO4, assessors must consider evidence relating to how the piece has taken shape and how well learners have created and developed ideas throughout the rehearsal process.

The following table explains in detail how to assess each bullet point on the assessment grid for AO4:

|                                                                 | Assessment grid                                                                                                         | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

|                                                                 | • relevant performance<br>techniques/conventions<br>associated with the chosen<br>practitioner/company/<br>style/genre. | • assess the effectiveness of the<br>choice and use of the<br>practitioner/company's<br>techniques/aims or genre<br>conventions in the creation and<br>development of the piece of<br>theatre.                        |
|                                                                 | • individual contribution to the<br>creation and development of<br>the piece of theatre.                                | • assess the individual<br>contribution of the learner. This<br>can include ideas which were<br>tested and rejected as well as<br>those evident in the final piece.                                                   |
| For actors only<br>consideration<br>should be given<br>to:      | • how the chosen<br>role/character(s) is created and<br>developed to communicate<br>meaning.                            | • assess choices made about the<br>role/character(s) during the<br>development process to<br>communicate meaning in<br>various situations.                                                                            |
|                                                                 | • how the performance space is<br>planned to communicate<br>meaning.                                                    | • assess the learner's decisions<br>during the development process<br>in regard to the performance<br>space, including<br>entrances/exits, levels,<br>proxemics, audience position to<br>communicate meaning.         |

{10}------------------------------------------------

| For designers<br>only<br>consideration<br>should be given<br>to: | • the creation and development of<br>design resources to<br>communicate meaning. | • assess choices made during<br>the development process<br>regarding the use of design<br>resources to communicate<br>meaning in various situations. |

|                                                                  | • how the design is planned to<br>communicate meaning.                           | • assess how well the design has<br>been planned during the<br>development process to<br>communicate meaning.                                        |

### Column 2 – Application of performance/design skills (AO2)

This assessment objective is assessed through the realisation of the final performance **or** design.

When assessing the application of skills, assessors must consider how well the learner has applied performance **or** design skills within the final piece in relation to their chosen practitioner/company/genre's artistic aims and/or conventions.

For actors, consideration should be given to:

- i) the application of appropriate physical skills, including:
  - gesture
  - stillness
  - fluency
  - expression
  - posture
  - facial expression
  - movement
  - proxemics.
- ii) the application of appropriate vocal skills, including:
  - pitch
  - pace/tempo
  - pause
  - accent
  - volume
  - clarity.
- iii) the appropriateness of the interaction with other actors, including:
  - fluency of cues
  - eye contact
  - pace and fluency of performance
  - listening and responding
  - interaction with audience (where appropriate and relevant)
  - interaction with set/props/costume (where appropriate and relevant).

{11}------------------------------------------------

For designers, consideration should be given to:

- i) the application of design skills and the degree to which they facilitate the action within the piece
- ii) the application of design resources within the piece, including the appropriate use of for example:

#### (lighting designers)

- intensity
- focus
- angle
- specials/gobos
- projections
- colour
- types of lantern
- positioning of lighting source
- fluency of cues.

#### (sound designers)

- music
- sound effects
- live sounds
- recorded sounds
- volume
- reverb/echo
- sound sources
- amplification including use of microphones
- positioning of sound sources on stage
- fluency of cues.

#### (set and props designers)

- the performance space and the placement of set and props
- backdrop/cyclorama
- wings/flats
- set dressing
- props
- furniture
- projection
- colour
- texture/fabrics
- entrances and exits
- sight lines.

#### (costume, hair and make-up designers)

- materials/fabrics
- garments
- hairstyles
- wigs
- make-up
- accessories
- colour/pattern.

{12}------------------------------------------------

### Column 3 – Interpretation of character/the piece and audience engagement (AO2)

This assessment objective is assessed through the realisation of the final performance **or**  design.

When assessing the interpretation of character (actors) assessors must consider how well the learner has communicated the character in performance. Was the character(s) motivations/status/relationships clear? Was the characterisation engaging?

When assessing the interpretation of the piece (designers) assessors must consider how well the learner has communicated the piece in design. Was there a sense of location/atmosphere/status/ evident within the design? Was this sustained throughout the piece? Were there effective subtleties in design?

### Column 4 – Contribution to the performance (AO2)

This assessment objective is assessed through the realisation of the final performance or design.

When assessing the contribution to the performance assessors must consider how well the individual performance **or** design contributed to the success of the final performance.

For actors, consideration should be given to:

- the energy and focus displayed
- confidence on stage
- performance time on stage.

For designers, consideration should be given to:

- how the design communicated atmosphere
- how the design enhanced the performance
- how the design enhanced the audience's understanding and theatrical experience.

{13}------------------------------------------------

# Task 2 – Reflective Log

Learners must reflect on the process of creating and developing their own piece of theatre and on the realisation of their performance **or** design.

Learners should be able to critically evaluate the effectiveness and impact of their creative choices linked to their:

- response to their chosen stimulus
- choice of practitioner/company/style/genre
- application of performance **or** design skills.

The appropriate band should be established by determining which performance descriptor best reflects the learner's performance.

The appropriate mark should then be established by determining the extent to which the learners has met the criteria within the relevant band – completely met (upper part of band), mostly met (middle of band), partially met (lower part of band).

It should be noted that all bands have been designed to assist the marking process by identifying individual levels of achievement and they do not correlate with grade boundaries.

### Design Assessment

### Minimum Requirements for Design

The following is a list of minimum requirements for the realisation of each design option:

#### Lighting design:

- **6** different states
- learners must operate the lighting board in the performance
- cue sheets.

#### Sound design:

- **6** different cues
- learners must operate the sound desk in the performance
- cue sheets.

### Set design and props design:

- set and props created and/or dressed for performance of **1** group
- learners must arrange the props table/set up performance space prior to the performance and provide a model set. The model may be presented in a digital format.

### Costume design, hair and make-up design:

- **1** full costume, hair and make-up for **2** different characters (two costume, hair and makeup designs in total)
- sketches of both costume, hair and make-up designs.

A piece of theatre which is significantly below the recommended minimum design requirements will be unlikely to demonstrate evidence of the skills required to access marks in the higher bands of the assessment criteria.
