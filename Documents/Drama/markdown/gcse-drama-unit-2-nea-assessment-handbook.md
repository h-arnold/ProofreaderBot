# Information for Teachers

This pack contains the assessment materials for Unit 2: Performance from a Text

Within this pack, you will find:

- information for teachers on how to manage arrangements for assessment
- information which must be shared with candidates that tells them about things that they must and must not do when they are completing the assessment
- the mark scheme that will be applied to assess candidates.

## Managing the assessment

This is a WJEC marked (external) non-examination assessment. The following arrangements must be followed when managing the assessment.

## Task setting

This assignment has been produced by WJEC and cannot be changed.

Candidates may choose **either** acting **or** design.

### Resources

Candidates must have access to the candidate assessment pack and any necessary resources, as specified in the detailed task tables within the candidate pack.

## Supervision

- No formal supervision.
- There is no restriction on the amount of time learners spend on exploring, creating and developing their performance/design from a published performance piece.
- Teachers may provide guidance and support to learners to ensure that they have a clear understanding of the requirements, for example, the assessment grid.
- Once the creating and developing work is underway, feedback must be limited to general advice on what needs to be improved. Teachers must **not** provide specific guidance on how to achieve these improvements.
- Teachers must see learners' ideas in progress at least three times at different stages during the process to be able to authenticate the work as the learner's own and complete the necessary authentication documentation.

### Authentication

Candidates must sign the declaration to confirm that the performance/design is their own work and that any sources used have been acknowledged.

Assessors must sign the declaration to confirm that performance/design was produced under the conditions set out in this assessment.

### Weighting:

There are 72 marks awarded in Unit 2 Unit 2 makes up 30% of the GCSE Drama qualification.

{5}------------------------------------------------

### Administration

Centres are reminded that the following documentation should be completed for Unit 2:

- Unit 2 Centre Approval Form
- Unit 2 Marksheet and Declaration Form
- Unit 2 Programme Proforma
- Unit 2 Unassessed Participant Declaration Form (where appropriate)

All information regarding the submission of these forms can be found in our [E-Submission](https://www.wjec.co.uk/home/administration/e-submission-upload/#tab_0)  [Guide \(Surpass\).](https://www.wjec.co.uk/home/administration/e-submission-upload/#tab_0)

## Candidate evidence

The teacher **must** be present for all performances and design vivas.

All performances and design vivas must be audio-visually recorded by the centre and submitted to WJEC within two weeks of the performance date.

All learners (including design learners) must be clearly identified by name and candidate number at the start of each group performance.

The recording must be of all the performances (with learners clearly identified at the start of each) which have been assessed live by the visiting examiner.

The recording of each piece must be the complete, unedited performance filmed from the audience perspective.

## Task marking

A visiting examiner from WJEC will mark all performances/designs produced by candidates.

Centres **must** ensure that candidate details and authentication signatures are provided on the candidate mark sheets prior to the visit and presented to the visiting examiner when they arrive.

### Further information

You should refer to the JCQ Instructions for conducting non-examination assessment for further information on managing assessment within our GCSE/Applied Qualifications.

You may also refer to [JCQ Information for candidates](https://www.jcq.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IFC-NE_Assessments_2021_v4.pdf) – non-examination assessments and the [JCQ Artificial Intelligence \(AI\) Use in Assessments: Protecting the Integrity of](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice/artificial-intelligence/)  [Qualifications.](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice/artificial-intelligence/)

### Assessment Details

Information regarding the task can be found within the candidate brief later in this document. Learners will have free choice of text for Unit 2, however, the choice of text must be different to the set text selected in Unit 3.

All learners must contribute fully to the development and creation of the piece of theatre. Performance pieces must therefore be carefully selected to ensure that all learners are able to fully demonstrate their chosen skill.

{6}------------------------------------------------

Centres should also ensure safe working practices for all learners.

Centres should note that it is not necessary for all learners in the teaching group to choose an extract(s) from the same performance text.

## Guidance for Assessment

The unit will be externally assessed by a visiting examiner anytime between January and May of the final year of the qualification.

Work which falls under the time limit will not be penalised. However, centres and learners should note that work which is significantly short is unlikely to be awarded in the higher mark bands as there may not be enough evidence of development and/or engagement with the audience.

Work which exceeds the time limit will not be penalised. However, centres and learners should note that only work which falls within the maximum timings will be assessed.

The appropriate band will be established by determining which performance descriptor best reflects the learner's performance.

The appropriate mark will then be established by determining the extent to which the learner has met the criteria within the relevant band **–** completely met (upper part of band), mostly met (middle of band), partially met (lower part of band).

The total marks for all 4 columns may reflect performance at different bands across the assessment objectives, for example, a learner may achieve band 4 for column 1 and band 5 for column 2.

It should be noted that the bands have been designed to assist the marking process by identifying individual levels of achievement and they do not correlate with grade boundaries.

There are assessment grids for each of the different options available:

- performance
- lighting design
- sound design
- set and props design
- costume, hair and make-up design.

There are 4 columns in each grid.

Column 1 within each grid assess AO4:

• learners' ability to create and develop ideas to communicate meaning.

Columns 2, 3 and 4 in each grid assess AO2:

- application of performance **or** design skills
- interpretation of character(s) **or** extract(s) and audience engagement
- contribution to the performance.

{7}------------------------------------------------

### Column 1 – Creating and developing ideas (AO4)

When assessing AO4, examiners will consider how the creation and development of ideas are evidenced within the final performance/design. They will assess the extent to which the final performance/design has been rehearsed and refined and demonstrates a holistic understanding of how meaning is communicated to an audience.

The following table explains in detail how to assess each bullet point on the assessment grid for AO4:

|                                                                  | Assessment grid                                                                                          | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| For all<br>learners,<br>consideration<br>should be given<br>to:  | • how ideas have been<br>developed to create a piece of<br>theatre from a published<br>performance text. | • assess to what extent the<br>learner has developed a<br>coherent and refined piece of<br>theatre.                                                                                                                                                                                      |

### Column 2 – Application of performance/design skills (AO2)

This assessment objective is assessed through the realisation of the final performance **or** design.

When assessing the application of skills, examiners will consider how well the learner has applied performance **or** design skills within the final piece.

For actors, consideration should be given to:

- i) the application of appropriate physical skills, including:
  - gesture
  - stillness
  - fluency
  - expression
  - posture
  - facial expression
  - movement
  - proxemics.
- ii) the application of appropriate vocal skills, including:
  - pitch
  - pace/tempo
  - pause
  - accent
  - volume
  - clarity.
- iii) the appropriateness of the interaction with other actors, including:
  - fluency of cues
  - eye contact
  - listening and responding
  - pace and fluency of performance
  - interaction with audience (where appropriate and relevant)
  - interaction with set/props/costume (where appropriate and relevant).

For designers, consideration should be given to: iv) the application of design skills and the degree to which they facilitate the action within the performance.

v) the application of design resources within the piece, including the appropriate use of for example:

###### lighting designers

- intensity
- focus
- angle
- specials/gobos
- projections
- colour
- types of lantern
- positioning of lighting source
- fluency of cues

{9}------------------------------------------------

###### sound designers

- music
- sound effects
- live sounds
- recorded sounds
- volume
- reverb/echo
- sound sources
- amplification including use of microphones
- positioning of sound sources on stage
- fluency of cues.

###### set and props designers

- the performance space and the placement of set and props
- backdrop/cyclorama
- wings/flats
- set dressing
- props
- furniture
- projection
- colour
- texture/fabrics
- entrances and exits
- sight lines.

## Costume, hair and make-up designers

- materials/fabrics
- garments
- hairstyles
- wigs
- make-up
- accessories
- colour/pattern.

### Column 3 – Interpretation of character(s)/extract(s) and audience engagement (AO2)

This assessment objective is assessed through the realisation of the final performance **or**  design.

**Actors:** When assessing the interpretation of character examiners will consider how well the learner has communicated the character in performance. Was the character(s) motivations/status/relationships clear? Was the characterisation engaging?

**Designers:** When assessing the interpretation of the extract(s) (designers) examiners will consider how well the learner has communicated the piece in design. Was there a sense of location/atmosphere/status/ evident within the design? Was this sustained throughout the performance? Were there effective subtleties in design?

{10}------------------------------------------------

### Column 4 – Contribution to the performance (AO2)

This assessment objective is assessed through the realisation of the final performance **or**  design.

When assessing the contribution to the performance examiners will consider how well the individual performance **or** design contributed to the success of the final performance.

For actors, consideration will be given to:

- the energy and focus displayed
- confidence on stage
- performance time on stage.

For designers, consideration will be given to:

- how the design communicated atmosphere
- how the design enhanced the performance how the design enhanced the audience's understanding and theatrical experience.

# Information for Candidates

You may choose to complete this unit as actors **or** designers, regardless of your chosen pathway in Unit 1.

If you choose design, you must choose **one** of the following options:

- lighting design
- sound design
- set and props design
- costume, hair and make-up design.

## Task

Create and develop an extract from a published performance text for performance. Demonstrate and apply your performance **or** design skills in a live performance.

## Time

The length of this piece of theatre will depend on the number of actors in the group and should be as follows:

• Group of two actors: 5-10 minutes • Group of three actors: 7-12 minutes • Group of four actors: 9-14 minutes

Each actor must interact with other actors and/or the audience **for a minimum of five minutes**. The number of designers in a group does not impact on the length of the piece. A piece of theatre or individual performance which is significantly below the recommended minimum performance length will be unlikely to demonstrate evidence of the skills required to access marks in the higher bands of the assessment criteria.

**All learners** must contribute fully to both the creation and performance of the piece of theatre.

### Viva (designers only)

All **designers** must give a 3–5-minute non assessed presentation of their design to the examiner. This viva will occur after the performance and can be presented in any format e.g. PowerPoint, oral presentation. The non-assessed viva is an opportunity for learners to explain and present their design to the examiner.

The following evidence could be included to support the presentation:

###### Lighting design:

• cue sheets

###### Sound design:

• cue sheets

Set design and props design:

• a model set. The model may be presented in a digital format.

Costume design, hair and make-up design:

• sketches of both costume, hair and make-up designs

{12}------------------------------------------------

You should also refer to the information on the front cover of the assessment brief which tells you about things that you **must** and **must not** do when you are completing your assessment. If there is anything that you do not understand, you **must** ask your teacher.

{13}------------------------------------------------

# Marking Scheme

The following mark scheme will be used to assess your work.

**0 marks will be awarded if there is no evidence or submitted work is not worthy of credit.**

### Design Assessment

### Minimum Requirements for Design

The following is a list of minimum requirements for the realisation of each design option:

###### Lighting design:

- **6** different states
- learners must operate the lighting board in the performance
- cue sheets (presented to the examiner in the non-assessed viva).

###### Sound design:

- **6** different cues
- learners must operate the sound desk in the performance
- cue sheets (presented to the examiner in the non-assessed viva).

## Set design and props design:

- set and props created and/or dressed for performance of **1** group
- learners must arrange the props table/set up performance space prior to the performance and provide a model set (presented to the examiner in the nonassessed viva). The model may be presented in a digital format.

###### Costume design, hair and make-up design:

- **1** full costume, hair and make-up for **2** different characters (two costume, hair and make-up designs in total)
- sketches of both costume, hair and make-up designs (presented to the examiner in the non-assessed viva).

A piece of theatre which is significantly below the recommended minimum design requirements will be unlikely to demonstrate evidence of the skills required to access marks in the higher bands of the assessment criteria.
