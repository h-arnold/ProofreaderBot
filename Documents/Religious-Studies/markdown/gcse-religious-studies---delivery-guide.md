## Aims of the Delivery Guide

The aim of the Delivery Guide is to give an overview of the qualification and to help teachers understand how we assess the GCSE. It will offer an introduction to the specification, an assessment overview, and will support teachers in better understanding how to prepare their learners for the assessment of the different units. More information on each unit can be found in the separate unit guides.

## Specification and Assessment Pack

When we develop new qualifications, we produce the following documents:

- Specification this covers all the information and skills that learners are expected to know by the end of their course.
- Assessment Pack this contains the Sample Assessment Materials (SAMs) i.e. sample exam papers and sample NEA tasks, relevant controls for the NEA and mark schemes.

This guide builds upon the information in the specification and assessment pack to help further your understanding of said documents.

<span id="page-9-1"></span>

#### Understanding the specification amplification

Learners should be made aware of:

- the specification stems
- what the specification stems mean.

<span id="page-9-2"></span>

#### Specification Stems

When you look through the specification you will notice in the amplification column, we use a variety of wording before the list of content learners need to know; we call this a stem:

![](_page_9_Figure_12.jpeg)

Each stem is used for a slightly different reason:

| Specification<br>Stem                            | When it is used                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Learners should<br>have a basic<br>understanding | When learners do not need to understand all aspects of the<br>specified content in detail (Please use the accompanying Unit<br>Guides to decide on the depth and breadth to which this content<br>should be taught). |
| Learners should<br>understand                    | When learners are required to demonstrate and apply knowledge to<br>familiar or unfamiliar contexts and can synthesise and evaluate<br>information for a given purpose.                                              |
| Learners should<br>be able to                    | When learners need to apply their knowledge and understanding to<br>source material or demonstrate application of practical skills and<br>techniques.                                                                |

{11}------------------------------------------------

<span id="page-10-0"></span>

## Command words

Learners should be made aware of:

- what command words are
- what each command word means
- what each command word assesses.

Command words are the words and phrases used in assessments that tell learners how they should answer the question or complete the task. Command words direct the learner through the question or task and indicate the nature of the response required.

![](_page_10_Picture_7.jpeg)

The following tables are not exhaustive but will give you a good idea of the command words we typically use:

| Command words for direct recall   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

#### **A developed description could include one of the following:**

- As vipassana is insight meditation, they may focus on their thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations but without reacting to them remaining detached from the experience.
- They may consider the arising and the passing away of thoughts, emotions and physical sensation (anicca) reflecting on the impermanent nature of these experiences.
- Vipassana meditation builds on samatha meditation and takes a lot of practice, so Buddhists must be patient and consistent.
- Some Buddhists may attend classes or courses for personalised guidance on how to meditate by experienced teachers who can offer specific techniques.

#### **Levels based mark schemes**

For questions requiring extended responses

**2.** Explain Christian beliefs and teachings and non-religious perspectives about abortion.

#### **Indicative Content**

Answers may refer to the following:

- Christians vary considerably in their perspectives towards abortion.
- Many Christians believe that life begins at conception and immediately the embryo is a fully human person that should not be harmed.
- Christians believe that humans are created by God, in his image and, therefore, all human life is sacred regardless of the stage of life it is at (Genesis 1:26).
- Many Christians argue that the commandment 'Do not kill' applies to all human life (Exodus 20:13).
- Christians believe that God has a plan for each human life and that abortion destroys this plan (Jeremaih 1:5).
- Many Christians support adoption as an alternative to abortion because life will not be lost.
- Many Christians are concerned about a 'slippery slope' where abortion is so widely accepted that it becomes a method of contraception.
- Some Christians argue that an embryo is not a fully human person until birth and might allow abortion in certain circumstances.
- Some Christians would accept the need for abortion in situations where the mother's life it at risk or in cases of rape or incest.
- Some Christians would accept the need for abortion if the foetus had severe abnormalities and was likely to be born disabled.
- People who hold non-religious beliefs differ considerably in their perspectives towards abortion. Many are pro-choice, but some are prolife.
- Many would argue that an embryo is not a fully human person until birth.
- Some argue that the woman should have complete autonomy over her body and that abortion should be free, legal and widely available.
- Many argue that abortion should be available to protect women's health.
- Many value quality of life as they do not believe in sanctity of life. They would consider the longer-term consequences of having an abortion on the mother and the child.
- Some might also be concerned about a 'slippery slope' where abortion is used too freely.
- Adoption may be considered an alternative to abortion, offering infertile individuals or couples the opportunity to become parents while improving the child's life and creating a loving family environment.

These opportunities are important to learners because they help develop a deeper understanding of the complex, pluralistic and diverse nature of societies. By exploring beliefs, values and practices across different contexts, learners can build empathy and tolerance while reflecting on their own values and the perspectives of others.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

#### **Example**

- This is relevant in Unit 4, where learners engage with fundamental human rights and learning about charities and organisations that support these rights. During their research, learners will consider the work and aims of these charities and/or organisations and will discover opportunities for volunteering for them.
- They may also learn about the roles people have in these charities and organisations, as a potential path to a career in the future.

### Cross-curricular Skills - **Literacy**

**There are many opportunities to include Literacy in GCSE Religious Studies. These opportunities are important to learners because they support the development of essential skills, such as reading comprehension, writing and verbal communication, through the exploration of complex texts and concepts. In GCSE Religious Studies, students engage with religious scriptures, ethical debates, and philosophical arguments, which strengthens their ability to analyse, interpret and express ideas clearly and coherently. Additionally, by discussing and reflecting on diverse viewpoints, students enhance their vocabulary, critical thinking and argumentation skills. These literacy skills are not only vital for academic success but also for effective communication in a wide range of personal and professional settings.**

**Below are some examples of how Literacy can be embedded into teaching and learning:**

#### Listening

##### *Example*

- In Unit 1, learners may to listen to a Buddhist monk explain the concept of rebirth and/or to listen to a convert to Buddhism (Tina Turner) chant the Nam Myoho Renge Kyo.
- Learners may watch and listen to various videos on the Humanist UK website to further their understanding of Humanist beliefs and perspectives on topics relevant to the GCSE, such as meaning of life or looking after the environment.

#### Reading

##### *Example*

- In RS, there are always opportunities to read through sources of wisdom and authority, such as sacred texts, summarise them and explain their meaning for religious believers.
- Learners may read key stories associated with the religions studied to understand their foundations and where fundamental religious beliefs originate, such as the story of the Buddha's Four Sights.

These opportunities are important to learners because they help develop practical numeracy skills through the analysis of data, patterns and statistics related to religious studies.

| There are many opportunities to include Digital Competence in GCSE Religious Studies. These opportunities are important to learners because they enable students to use digital tools and resources to explore and analyse religious topics in a modern context. Through online research, students can access diverse viewpoints, explore global religious perspectives and engage with up-to-date information. Digital competence also allows students to present their ideas effectively using digital formats, whether through presentations, essays or collaborative projects. These skills are crucial not only for success in GCSE Religious Studies but also for preparing students to navigate an increasingly digital world, enhancing their overall academic and professional readiness.<br>Below are some examples of how Digital Competence can be embedded into teaching and learning: |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

**There are many opportunities to include Personal Effectiveness in GCSE Religious Studies. These opportunities are important to learners because they help students develop self-awareness, resilience, and the ability to reflect on their own values, beliefs and decisions. By engaging with topics such as ethical dilemmas, personal responsibility and the role of faith in daily life, students are encouraged to build confidence in their own views while respecting the perspectives of others.** 

**Below are some examples of how Personal Effectiveness can be embedded into teaching and learning:**

#### Personal Effectiveness

##### *Example*

- In Units 2 and 4, to achieve the desired outcome learners will need to work effectively through the tasks and requirements. Prior teacher support and guidance on the steps needed to be an effective worker would be beneficial.
- Learners could discuss the challenges for completing the work to recognise what needs to be done, how it needs to be done and by when it needs completing. They could then apply this to their work prior to its completion for the NEA units.
- Learners can analyse and evaluate differing religious and non-religious perspectives on ethical issues such as stewardship, creation and life after death, fostering their ability to assess arguments, identify biases and form their own reasoned opinions.
- Opportunities to research topics like pilgrimage or diverse beliefs on the meaning of life using digital resources allow learners to practise responsible online inquiry, evaluate sources and present findings effectively.
- Group discussions and debates on topics like relationships or medical ethics enable learners to articulate their own views, listen to other and build mutual understanding, enhancing interpersonal and communication skills.
