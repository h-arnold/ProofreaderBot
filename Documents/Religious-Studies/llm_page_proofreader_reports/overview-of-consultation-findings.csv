0,3,have decided,Qualifications Wales **have decided** that these qualifications will be introduced in a phased way; WJEC is now developing the qualifications that are to be available for first teaching from September 2025 to meet these requirements.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,"'Qualifications Wales' is a singular entity (an organisation), and therefore requires a singular verb ('has decided') for subject-verb agreement."
1,4,links to learners undertaking,"A notable area of concern in consultation responses and discussions with stakeholder groups **links to learners undertaking** non-examination assessment across a number of subjects, and the potential negative impact this could have on learner wellbeing.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The phrasing 'links to learners undertaking' is slightly awkward; 'is linked to learners undertaking' or 'concerns learners undertaking' would be more grammatically conventional and clearer.
2,4,wellbeing,"A notable area of concern in consultation responses and discussions with stakeholder groups links to learners undertaking non-examination assessment across a number of subjects, and the potential negative impact this could have on learner **wellbeing**.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"The term 'well-being' is hyphenated on page 5 ('well-being, equity and inclusion'), indicating a preferred style that should be consistent throughout the document."
3,4,nonexamination,This was particularly prevalent in qualifications where the **nonexamination** assessment is either new or significantly increased.,ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,95,The term 'non-examination' should be hyphenated in British English.
4,5,as meaning,"Welsh Government's guidance on well-being, equity and inclusion [\(https://hwb.gov.wales/evaluation-improvement-andaccountability/the-national-resource-evaluation-and-improvement/what-is-the-nationalresource/well-being-equity-and-inclusion/\)](https://hwb.gov.wales/evaluation-improvement-and-accountability/the-national-resource-evaluation-and-improvement/what-is-the-national-resource/well-being-equity-and-inclusion/) describes equity **as meaning** equitable access to opportunities to perform in assessments, access to the same materials and spaces, unbiased assessment tasks, preventing prejudice or stereotyping and allowing students to access the assessment regardless of their background.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The phrase 'as meaning' is redundant; 'describes equity as equitable access' or 'describes equity to mean equitable access' would be more concise.
5,5,nonexamination,"Some stakeholders felt that **nonexamination** assessment can further disadvantage some learners, for example, those who do not have support or access to adequate resources at home.",ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,95,The term 'non-examination' should be hyphenated in British English.
6,5,noted that they felt that,"Respondents **noted that they felt that** appropriate controls should be in place to ensure that all schools assess fairly, or there could be a lack of confidence in qualification results which would consequently mean learner attainment would have less value associated with it.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The phrasing 'noted that they felt that' is wordy; 'Respondents felt that' or 'Respondents noted that' would be more concise and direct.
7,5,maximalise,"However, one stakeholder group had a different view on what impacted equity, requesting that the GCSEs have a range of assessment methods, focusing on competency-based continuous assessment methods, rather than coursework or mini-tests, to **maximalise** equity.",ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,95,'Maximalise' is not a standard British English word; the correct term is 'maximise'.
8,5,Qualification Wales,"When we submit our qualifications to **Qualification Wales** for approval, we must stipulate how we have managed the balance of manageability, engagement, reliability and validity.",ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,95,"The proper noun is 'Qualifications Wales' (plural), as used consistently elsewhere in the document."
9,6,nonexamination,"Where this is the case, scanning and uploading of **nonexamination** assessment could be time-consuming, particularly when considering the scale of non-examination assessment across the suite of qualifications.",ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,95,The term 'non-examination' should be hyphenated in British English.
10,8,being from,"WJEC received 24 responses, with the majority of those **being from** practitioners within a school.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,"The phrasing 'the majority of those being from' is wordy and could be more concise, for example, 'the majority from' or 'most of whom were practitioners'."
11,9,*.,"The Approval Criteria note that as part of the devising unit, learners must submit a reflective log in a non-prescribed format; this will be compulsory to access the full range of **marks*.***",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"A stray asterisk appears immediately before the full stop, which is an extraneous character and incorrect punctuation."
12,9,states,The Approval Criteria **states** that 30% of the qualification must be assessed by external examination which must include questions on unprepared works.,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"The subject 'Approval Criteria' is treated as plural elsewhere in the document (e.g., 'note', 'state'), making 'states' inconsistent here. It should be 'state'."
13,10,and that the assessment approach is appropriate,"The majority of respondents agreed that the proposed qualification will support the Curriculum for Wales. Respondents generally agreed or partially agreed that the proposed assessment approach is appropriate, that the unit purposes are appropriate and engaging for learners and meet the qualification purpose and aims, **and that the assessment approach is appropriate**.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,90,"The phrase 'and that the assessment approach is appropriate' is redundant, as it was already stated earlier in the sentence, making the sentence unnecessarily long."
14,11,raised around,Some concerns were **raised around** the number of non-examination assessments.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,'Raised about' is generally preferred over 'raised around' when discussing concerns or issues for greater precision.
15,11,As the Approval Criteria state that one of the non-examination assessments must be marked by the centre and moderated by the WJEC,"Consequently, we have now decided that the fieldwork will be set and marked by WJEC. **As the Approval Criteria state that one of the non-examination assessments must be marked by the centre and moderated by the WJEC**, the Decision Making Exercise will now be marked by centres and moderated by WJEC; this non-examination assessment is 15% of the qualification and is therefore smaller than the fieldwork non-examination assessment at 25%.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,90,"The clause is repeated unnecessarily within the same paragraph, making the sentence clunky and affecting flow. It could be rephrased for better conciseness."
16,12,whilst,"Some respondents expressed that there was excessive emphasis on Welsh history (Unit 1 – An in-depth study on Welsh history and Unit 4 – Wales and Britain/the UK) **whilst** others welcomed the focus, noting that they felt it aligned with the Curriculum for Wales.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,'While' is generally preferred over 'whilst' in modern British English for conciseness and contemporary style.
17,12,People and progress?,"We have also renamed Unit 4; it will now be called '**People and progress?**' We have retained the focus of Unit 1 on specifically Welsh history, in line with the Approval Criteria, which states learners must be given an opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge and understanding of Welsh history, along with Wales and the Welsh perspective.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,A question mark in a formal unit title is unconventional and may be a stylistic choice that warrants review for appropriateness in a WJEC document.
18,13,was manageable,Respondents generally agreed or partially agreed that the proposed qualification structure and assessment approach is appropriate and that the proposed qualification **was manageable** for learners.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The verb tense should be consistent with 'is appropriate' in the parallel clause, referring to the current state of the proposed qualification."
19,13,outcomes on,"As explained in Qualifications Wales' report on their **outcomes on** the Approval Criteria consultation [\(https://qualifications.wales/media/knaphlc0/consultation-outcomes-by-subject.pdf\)](https://qualifications.wales/media/knaphlc0/consultation-outcomes-by-subject.pdf), GCSE Religious Studies is not designed to cover all aspects of the Religion, Values and Ethics (RVE) guidance.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,'Outcomes of' or 'outcomes from' is more idiomatic and clearer in British English when referring to the results of a consultation.
20,14,i.e. human rights,"• Relating to the specific units, some respondents felt there were repeated topics **i.e. human rights**, with some respondents questioning why a religious studies qualification was teaching human rights.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,"'i.e.' should typically be followed by a comma. If 'human rights' is an example, 'e.g.' is more appropriate. If it's the specific topic, a colon would be clearer."
21,14,nonreligious,"Unit 3 – Human experience and the world focuses on how environmental issues are approached by people with different religious and/or **nonreligious** beliefs, whereas, Unit 4 – Human rights focuses on ethical/moral, human rights issues from religious and non-religious perspectives.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,95,"The document consistently uses 'non-religious' elsewhere (e.g., page 13), making 'nonreligious' an inconsistency."
22,14,"ethical/moral,","Unit 3 – Human experience and the world focuses on how environmental issues are approached by people with different religious and/or nonreligious beliefs, whereas, Unit 4 – Human rights focuses on **ethical/moral, human rights issues** from religious and non-religious perspectives.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,90,The comma is unnecessary as 'ethical/moral' functions as a compound adjective modifying 'human rights issues'.
23,14,of the,"Consequently, we have decided to change the release dates of Unit 2 and 3 **of the non-examination tasks** to May of the first year of study, thus giving learners and teachers more time to prepare.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The phrase 'of the' is redundant here; 'Unit 2 and 3 non-examination tasks' is more concise and common phrasing.
24,15,for the number,- Some respondents expressed concern about the potential amount of content to be covered **for the number** of teaching hours available.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,75,'For' is a less precise preposition here; 'given' or 'in' would more clearly convey the relationship between content and available time.
25,15,from reading,"It will validly secure the requirements of the Approval Criteria that learners must develop their skills **from reading** a variety of text and media, understand and interpret their meaning and message and allow them to further explore ""Cymraeg and me"", whilst building on the skills and knowledge developed as part of the Core Cymraeg qualification.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"'From' implies origin, whereas 'through' or 'by' correctly indicates the method or means by which skills are developed."
26,16,represent,Our specification writer for this unit is aware of the concerns and we will aim to include writing that **represent** a variety of perspectives reflecting the diverse nature of Welsh citizenship and its cultures in order to make the unit interesting and relevant to learners.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The verb 'represent' should be 'represents' to agree with the singular subject 'writing'.
27,17,set text,"In response, we are exploring opportunities to add **set text** to Unit 2 and Unit 4. This would help ensure the study of a range of literature whilst promoting flexibility and choice for centres in terms of topics, themes, and diversity.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,90,"Given the context of 'a variety of literary works' and 'opportunities to add', 'set text' should be pluralised to 'set texts'."
28,17,awards,"Given the requirement of the Approval Criteria that a certain percentage of the single and double **awards** units should be common to both qualification routes, we believe that the proposed structure is the most appropriate one to meet these demands.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"The term 'single and double award' is used elsewhere in the document (e.g., in the heading 'GCSE English Language and Literature (Single and Double)'), so 'awards units' should be 'award units' for consistency."
29,18,students,"We have therefore decided to move poetry to an examined unit in the Single Award, where **students** will respond in writing. Learners following the Single Award will now have the group discussion focused on non-fiction texts.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,The document predominantly uses the term 'learners' to refer to those undertaking the qualification; 'students' should be changed to 'learners' for consistency.
30,18,and Unit 3 requires,The current GCSE English Literature qualification requires the assessment of poetry in two units: the comparison of two unseen poems in Unit 1 **and Unit 3 requires** the comparison of two poems from fifteen specified poems listed for study.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The sentence structure is grammatically awkward; the 'and' attempts to connect two independent clauses in a way that creates a run-on sentence. It should be rephrased, for example, 'Unit 1 involves the comparison... and Unit 3 requires...' or split into two sentences."
31,18,were considered,"The length of the examinations for Units 1, 4 and 6 **were considered** by some respondents to be too long. Consequently, we have shortened the duration of these exams from 2 hours to 1.5 hours each.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The subject of the sentence is 'length' (singular), so the verb should be 'was considered' to maintain subject-verb agreement."
32,19,high frequency and high utility,"Some respondents noted that they were pleased to see relevant broad themes, inclusion of cultural and societal awareness in the countries of the assessed languages, the use of **high frequency and high utility** grammar and core vocabulary, an extensive and comprehensive list of grammar and a more skills-centred approach.",ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,90,Compound adjectives 'high-frequency' and 'high-utility' should be hyphenated when preceding a noun in British English.
33,19,an extensive and comprehensive list of grammar and a more skills-centred approach.,"Some respondents noted that they were pleased to see relevant broad themes, inclusion of cultural and societal awareness in the countries of the assessed languages, the use of high frequency and high utility grammar and core vocabulary, **an extensive and comprehensive list of grammar and a more skills-centred approach.**",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,An Oxford comma should be used before the final 'and' in a list of three or more items for clarity in formal writing.
34,19,equally split response,We asked stakeholders for their preference for a 4- or 5-unit structure and received an **equally split response**.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The phrasing 'equally split response' is slightly informal; 'an evenly split response' or 'responses were equally divided' would be more formal.
35,19,Taking into regard,"**Taking into regard** all comments from the consultation, there was concern that five units may put learners off from opting for a language and that it would appear to be more challenging than other subjects.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The idiom 'Taking into regard' is incorrect; it should be 'Taking into consideration' or 'Having regard to'.
36,19,around the number,- Some concerns were raised **around the number** of non-examination assessments.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,75,The preposition 'around' is less formal in this context; 'regarding' or 'about' would be more appropriate for a formal document.
37,19,take up,- Some responses in the consultation referred to non-tiering impacting learner confidence and **take up**.,ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,90,"As a noun, 'take-up' (meaning adoption or participation) should be hyphenated in British English."
38,19,8 sub-themes and 18 sub-sub themes,"- There was some concern regarding the number of themes (the current spec has 3 broad themes, **8 sub-themes and 18 sub-sub themes**).",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,An Oxford comma should be used before the final 'and' in a list of three or more items for clarity in formal writing.
39,19,over the timing,- There was some concern **over the timing** of Unit 1 non-examination assessment in terms of clashes with Welsh oral assessments during the established 5-week oral assessment window.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,75,The preposition 'over' is less formal in this context; 'regarding' or 'about' would be more appropriate for a formal document.
40,19,over the duration,- Some concerns were also raised **over the duration** of the Unit 3 listening exam (set at 45 minutes) which was deemed to be too long.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,75,The preposition 'over' is less formal in this context; 'regarding' or 'about' would be more appropriate for a formal document.
41,19,"35 mins with 5 mins additional reading time, and Higher Tier 45 with 5 mins additional reading time.","However, the current Foundation Tier listening is set at **35 mins with 5 mins additional reading time, and Higher Tier 45 with 5 mins additional reading time.**",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,90,"The sentence fragment 'Higher Tier 45' is missing a verb ('is set at') for grammatical completeness, and 'mins' should be 'minutes' for formal writing."
42,20,Qualifications Wales have,"However, **Qualifications Wales have** since removed this requirement from the Approval Criteria and the qualification outline has therefore been revised to include translation from the assessed language into English only.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"'Qualifications Wales' is a singular entity, requiring the singular verb 'has' for subject-verb agreement."
43,20,engaging for learners and meet,The majority of respondents agreed that the proposed qualification structure and assessment approach is appropriate; that the focus of units is appropriate; that the unit purposes are **engaging for learners and meet** the qualification purpose and aims; and that the proposed qualification will support the Curriculum for Wales.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,An Oxford comma should be used before the final 'and' in a list of three or more items for clarity in formal writing.
44,21,the focus of the units were,The majority of respondents agreed that **the focus of the units were** appropriate and that they were relevant and engaging for learners.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The singular subject 'focus' requires the singular verb 'was' for subject-verb agreement.

49,21,nonexamination assessment,- A number of respondents expressed concern regarding the move away from **nonexamination assessment** to a 2-hour digital exam to assess programming.,ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,90,The compound adjective 'non-examination' requires a hyphen in British English.
50,22,have announced,"Qualifications Wales **have announced** that a Single Award GCSE Science qualification will be available for first teaching in 2026, a year after the Double Award qualification is available.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,The subject 'Qualifications Wales' is a singular entity and requires the singular verb 'has announced'.
51,22,subreporting,The Sciences Double Award will be designed to support progression to science AS and A level qualifications and the **subreporting** will help centres measure attainment of the separate science disciplines.,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"The term 'sub-reporting' was hyphenated earlier in the document ('sub-reporting of grades'), so 'subreporting' should also be hyphenated for consistency."
52,22,"and, the","There was some concern about the proposed approach to the assessment timing for Unit 1 – Bringing the Sciences Together **and, the** appropriateness of the focus of the unit.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The comma after 'and' is superfluous and disrupts the flow; it should be removed.
