Professional Learning events on preparing to assess internally marked NEA will be available in the autumn term 2025.,ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,90,"As a noun, 'walk-through' is typically hyphenated in British English (OED, Collins)."
3,2,They currently have,A: No - decisions around which GCSEs are offered in Wales rest with Qualifications Wales. **They currently have** no plans to provide a short course.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"'Qualifications Wales' is a singular entity, so the pronoun should be 'It' for subject-verb agreement."
4,3,the Curriculum,"**Q: Will WJEC credit and support the use of more local examples to support Cynefin within the Curriculum?** A: Yes, absolutely! Where the word 'including' is mentioned in the specification, this content must be taught.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,85,"Given 'Curriculum for Wales' is capitalised on page 2, 'the Curriculum' should also be capitalised here for consistency when referring to the specific national curriculum."

This will ensure that all marking within the centre is to the same standard.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,"The phrasing 'No – whilst' is informal and could be improved for a formal document, e.g., 'No; whilst schools...' or 'No, whilst schools...'."

8,3,been sat,"Once the assessment has **been sat** for the first time, it will be kept under review, but it is not expected that it will require major changes. It should be noted that we are not able to make changes to any qualification without going through an amendment process with Qualifications Wales.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,90,'Sat' is informal when referring to taking an assessment; 'taken' or 'completed' is more appropriate in formal writing.

The content for unit 1 has some similarities to the current specification, including the inclusion of non-religious beliefs.",ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,95,"'Lead-in time' is a compound noun and should be hyphenated in British English (OED, Collins)."
10,4,units 1-3,"This means that though **units 1-3** will be available in 2026, two units will need to be sat by candidates in 2027 to satisfy the terminal rule.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"The term 'Unit' is consistently capitalised elsewhere in the document (e.g., 'Unit 1, 2 and 3', 'Unit 2 NEA', 'Unit 3 exam', 'Unit 4'), so 'Units 1-3' should also be capitalised for consistency."
