## GCSE HEALTH AND SOCIAL CARE, AND CHILDCARE

## <span id="page-6-0"></span>1 INTRODUCTION

#### <span id="page-6-1"></span>1.1 Aims

GCSE Health and Social Care, and Childcare supports learners to:

- understand the principles of human development, health and wellbeing
- explore how the health and social care, and childcare sectors support and promote the development, health and wellbeing of individuals
- describe the principles, values and approaches that underpin the work of health and social care, and childcare professionals in Wales
- understand key conditions and illnesses in adulthood and childhood
- explore the cross-cutting theme of human rights and diversity, particularly in relation to service provision in health and social care, and childcare.

#### <span id="page-6-2"></span>1.2 Curriculum for Wales

This GCSE Health and Social Care, and Childcare qualification is underpinned by the Curriculum for Wales framework and has been designed to ensure that learners can continue to make progress towards the four purposes whilst studying for this qualification. Central to this design are the [principles of progression,](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/health-and-well-being/principles-of-progression/) along with the [statements of what matters](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/health-and-well-being/statements-of-what-matters/) and those [subject specific skills and concepts](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/health-and-well-being/designing-your-curriculum/#specific-considerations-for-this-area) outlined in the '[Designing your Curriculum](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/health-and-well-being/designing-your-curriculum/)' section of the Health and wellbeing Area of Learning and Experiences.

In developing this qualification, we have considered where there are opportunities to embed the cross-curricular themes and where there are opportunities for integral skills and cross-curricular skills to be developed. Appendix A provides a simple mapping, and information to support teachers will be provided in the Guidance for Teaching.

We have also considered where the qualification can generate opportunities for integrating the learning experiences noted on page 32; the Guidance for Teaching will include further information on integrating these learning experiences into delivery. 

{8}------------------------------------------------

The GCSE Health and Social Care, and Childcare qualification supports the Curriculum for Wales by:

- supporting the statements of what matters[1](#page-7-0) , by giving learners the opportunity to:
  - understand the factors that affect physical health and wellbeing throughout the lifespan including health-promoting behaviours, for example, physical activity, including an understanding of health-harming behaviours
  - develop positive, informed behaviours that encourage learners to care for and respect themselves and others in a health and social care, and childcare context
  - help learners explore the connections between their experiences, mental health and emotional wellbeing
  - create a culture where talking about mental health and emotional wellbeing is normalised in health and social care, and childcare
  - develop the critical-thinking skills necessary to consider their decision-making in terms of possible implications including risks, for themselves and others
  - engage critically with social influences within their own culture, as well as those of others, to understand how norms and values develop
  - understand how decisions and actions impact on themselves, on others, and on wider society, both now and in the future
  - help to understand the factors that influence decision-making, placing them in a better position to make more informed and considered decisions around health and social care, and childcare
  - develop the critical-thinking skills necessary to consider decision-making in terms of possible implications in the health and social care, and childcare sectors.
- supporting the principles of progression[2](#page-7-1) by encouraging learners to:
  - develop their independence and agency in matters relating to health and wellbeing, resulting in a growing responsibility for their own health and wellbeing
  - develop conceptual knowledge and critical understanding in a range of aspects of health and wellbeing and personal behaviour
  - develop connections between aspects of health and wellbeing and a wide range of topics and issues in health and social care, and childcare contexts
  - develop an appreciation for the needs of others in health and social care, and childcare contexts and the impact of decisions, actions and circumstances
  - become more socially responsible
  - develop the understanding of advocacy on behalf of themselves and of others through health and social care, and childcare contexts.

{9}------------------------------------------------

- supporting the subject specific considerations for GCSE Health and Social Care, and Childcare[3](#page-8-2) by giving learners the opportunity to:
  - develop literacy skills, being able to organise writing and adapt language confidently, enabling learners to apply for learning pathways and a preferred career, possibly in health and social care and / or childcare
  - support learners to explore and understand in depth, developmental changes across the lifespan, as well as how those changes affect individuals in a range of different ways
  - learn and understand how to assess and manage risk so they can keep themselves and others safe, including safeguarding within a health and social care, and childcare context
  - reflect on the short-term, medium-term and long-term implications of the decisions they make. It should be recognised that learners do not necessarily have responsibility for many of the decisions affecting them and this responsibility grows over time
  - understand the role that social influences can play on learner behaviour and the influences that can promote and encourage healthy prosocial behaviours, as well as those that lead to issues such as discrimination, racism or prejudice throughout the health and social care, and childcare sectors
  - understand the role and importance of relationships such as family and friends, pets/animals, peers, professional, virtual, romantic, sexual, religious and spiritual *–* through health and social care, and childcare contexts, and those relationships which they may not yet be familiar with but are highly likely to encounter in their lives or whilst working in the sectors.

## <span id="page-8-0"></span>1.3 Prior learning and progression

Although there is no specific requirement for prior learning, the qualification is designed primarily for learners between the ages of 14 and 16 and builds on the conceptual understanding learners have developed through their learning from ages 3 – 14.

The qualification allows learners to develop a strong foundation of knowledge, skills and understanding which supports progression to post-16 study and prepares learners for life, learning and work. The qualification provides a suitable foundation for the study of Health and Social Care, and Childcare at either AS or A level, and appropriate Level 2 and Level 3 qualifications in this subject. In addition, the specification provides a coherent, satisfying and worthwhile course of study for learners who do not progress to further study in this subject.

## <span id="page-8-1"></span>1.4 Guided learning hours

GCSE Health and Social Care, and Childcare has been designed to be delivered within 120 – 140 guided learning hours. The qualification has been primarily designed as a 2-year programme for learners in years 10 and 11.

<span id="page-8-2"></span><sup>3</sup> <https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/health-and-well-being/designing-your-curriculum/>

{10}------------------------------------------------

#### <span id="page-9-0"></span>1.5 Use of language

As our understanding of diversity, equity, and inclusion evolves, so must our language. Updated terminology better reflects individual identities and fosters respect and accuracy. Language used should be as specific as possible. Staying informed and adaptable is crucial, as inclusive language promotes dignity and equity. Recognising that language will continue to evolve, we will remain open to further amendments to ensure it accurately represents and supports all individuals. WJEC will inform centres of any amendments and the most up to date version of the specification will always be on the website.

### <span id="page-9-1"></span>1.6 Equality and fair access

The specification may be followed by any learner, irrespective of gender, ethnic, religious or cultural background. It has been designed to avoid, where possible, features that could, without justification, make it more difficult for a learner to access and achieve because they have a particular protected characteristic.

The protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010 are age, disability, gender reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and sexual orientation.

Access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are made for eligible learners to enable them to access the assessments and demonstrate their knowledge and skills without changing the demands of the assessment.

Information on access arrangements and reasonable adjustments is found in the following document from the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ): Access Arrangements, Reasonable Adjustments: General and Vocational Qualifications. This document is available on the JCQ website [\(www.jcq.org.uk\)](http://www.jcq.org.uk/).

We will be following the principles set out in this document and, as a consequence of provision for reasonable adjustments, very few learners will encounter a complete barrier to any part of the assessment.

{11}------------------------------------------------

## <span id="page-10-0"></span>2 SUBJECT CONTENT

#### <span id="page-10-1"></span>How to read the amplification

The amplification provided in the right-hand column uses the following four stems:

- 'Learners should be aware of' is used when learners do not need to understand all aspects of the specified content in detail. Teachers should refer to Guidance for Teaching documents for further guidance on the depth and breadth to which this content should be taught.
- 'Learners should know' is used when learners are required to demonstrate basic knowledge and understanding.
- 'Learners should understand' is used when learners are required to demonstrate greater depth of knowledge and understanding, application of knowledge to familiar or unfamiliar contexts and analysis and evaluation of information for a given purpose.
- 'Learners should be able to' is used when learners need to apply their knowledge and understanding.

The use of the word 'including' indicates that the specified content must be taught and could be subject to assessment.

The use of the words 'for example' or 'such as' indicates that the specified content is for guidance only, and alternative examples could be chosen.

#### <span id="page-10-2"></span>Unit Information

Learners will be given opportunities to explore human rights and diversity throughout the three units, including consideration of:

- access to service provision across health and social care, and childcare
- the impact of service provision and delivery on outcomes in relation to health and social care, and childcare
- Black, Asian and minority ethnic perspectives, identity, culture, experiences and contributions.

#### <span id="page-32-0"></span>Opportunities for integration of learning experiences

GCSE Health and Social Care, and Childcare generates opportunities for the following learning experiences to be developed (experiences will not be directly assessed):

- explore local health and social care, and childcare provision and services to make connections that develop a stronger sense of cynefin
- explore career opportunities within health and social care, and childcare
- hear directly from, and interact with, health and social care, and childcare professionals, either in person or online, to appreciate their experiences of working within the sector
- make appropriate use of digital technology
- develop collaboration and teamwork skills by working with, and learning from, others.

The Guidance for Teaching will include further information on the opportunities provided by the qualification for teachers / centres to integrate these learning experiences and skills into delivery.

For opportunities to develop cross-cutting themes, cross-curricular skills and integral skills please see Appendix A.

{35}------------------------------------------------

#### <span id="page-34-0"></span>3.2 Arrangements for non-examination assessment

#### **Unit 2**

For this assessment, learners are required to complete an assessment based on a choice of two case studies where they apply knowledge and understanding of adult health and social care. Learners may choose one of two case studies they would like to complete for the non-examination assessment. It is not necessary for the whole cohort to select the same case study.

The assessment will be released during the first week of September for assessment in that academic year. The case studies and tasks will change annually. Learners should not have access to the case studies or tasks until the start of the assessment. Centres have the flexibility to decide when, during the academic year, learners undertake the assessment.

This non-examination assessment contributes to 30% of the overall qualification grade and will take 12 hours to complete. The assessment could be completed in several sittings due to the length of the non-examination assessment. The assessment will be marked out of a total of 60 marks.

This unit will be assessed through an externally set assessment and will be marked by the centre and moderated by WJEC. Assessments must be submitted digitally.

#### **Unit 3**

For this assessment, learners are required to complete:

- an assessment based on a case study
- an investigation

where they apply knowledge and understanding of childcare.

The assessment will be released during the first week of September for assessment in that academic year. The case study and tasks will change annually, and the investigation will remain static. Learners should not have access to the case study or tasks until the start of the assessment. Centres have the flexibility to decide when, during the academic year, learners undertake the assessment.

This non-examination assessment contributes to 30% of the overall qualification grade and will take 12 hours to complete. The assessment could be completed in several sittings due to the length of the non-examination assessment. The assessment will be marked out of a total of 60 marks.

## <span id="page-35-0"></span>4 MALPRACTICE

Before the course starts, the teacher is responsible for informing candidates of WJEC's regulations concerning malpractice. Candidates must not take part in any unfair practice in the preparation of work for GCSE Health and Social Care, and Childcare.

Information regarding malpractice is available in our [Guide to preventing, reporting and](https://www.wjec.co.uk/media/0pjats1l/guide-to-preventing-reporting-and-investigating-malpractice-april-2022-002.pdf)  [investigating malpractice.](https://www.wjec.co.uk/media/0pjats1l/guide-to-preventing-reporting-and-investigating-malpractice-april-2022-002.pdf)

All cases of suspected or actual malpractice must be reported immediately to WJEC (malpractice@wjec.co.uk). If candidates commit malpractice, they may be penalised or disqualified from the examinations.

In all cases of malpractice, centres are advised to consult the JCQ booklet [Suspected](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice)  [Malpractice: Policies and Procedures.](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice)

## <span id="page-36-0"></span>5 TECHNICAL INFORMATION

#### <span id="page-36-1"></span>5.1 Entries and awards

This is a unitised qualification. Learners are entered for each unit separately.

Assessment opportunities will be available in the summer assessment period each year, until the end of the life of the specification.

Unit 1 will be available in 2027 (and each year thereafter). Unit 2 and Unit 3 will be available in 2028 (and each year thereafter) and the qualification will be awarded for the first time in summer 2028.

Pre-16 Candidates (i.e. candidates who are 16 or under on 31st August in the academic year in which they were entered).

The terminal rule is set at 40% of the overall qualification for GCSE Health and Social Care, and Childcare.

If the assessment being re-taken contributes to the 40% terminal rule requirement, the mark for the new assessment will count regardless of previous results in that assessment.

Candidates may resit an individual unit once only. The better uniform mark score from the two attempts will be used in calculating the final overall grade subject to the terminal rule being satisfied first i.e. that candidates must complete a minimum amount of the assessment for a qualification in the series in which they are cashing in.

If any unit has been attempted twice and a candidate wishes to enter the unit for the third time, the candidate will have to re-enter all units and the appropriate cash-in(s). This is referred to as a 'fresh start'. When retaking a qualification (fresh start), a candidate may have up to two attempts at each unit. However, no results from examination units taken prior to the fresh start can be used in aggregating the new grade(s).

If a candidate has been entered for but is absent for a unit, the absence does not count as an attempt. The candidate would, however, qualify as a resit candidate in the final resit series.

Marks for non-examination assessment may be used for the life of the specification.

{38}------------------------------------------------

#### Post-16 Candidates (i.e. candidates who are 16 or over on 1st September in the academic year in which they are entered)

There is no terminal rule that applies to Post-16 Candidates for GCSE Heath and Social Care, and Childcare.

There is no limit on the number of times a candidate can resit an individual unit; however, the better uniform mark score from the most two recent attempts will be used in calculating the final overall grade.

The 'fresh start' rule does not apply to post-16 candidates.

If a candidate has been entered for but is absent for a unit, the absence does not count as an attempt. The candidate would, however, qualify as a resit candidate in the final resit series.

Marks for non-examination assessment may be used for the life of the specification.
