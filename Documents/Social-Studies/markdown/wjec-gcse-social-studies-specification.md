## GCSE SOCIAL STUDIES

<span id="page-6-0"></span>

## 1 INTRODUCTION

<span id="page-6-1"></span>

### 1.1 Aims

GCSE Social Studies supports learners to:

- develop an understanding of how to become ethical, informed and responsible citizens of Wales and the world
- develop a greater understanding of the world and of other people and their values
- engage with contemporary social issues, and explore identity, rights and democracy
- explore social issues and consider how to actively participate and engage in social action
- appreciate the complex, pluralistic and diverse nature of society by understanding identity, rights and responsibilities, equality and inequality, and how these issues shape people, places and community
- reflect on the influence of governance on people, places and community
- explore the cross-cutting theme of human rights and diversity, including Black, Asian, and minority ethnic perspectives, identity, culture and contributions.

These aims are set out in Qualifications Wales' Approval Criteria.

The GCSE Social Studies qualification will be based on the following concepts:

- authority and governance
- cause and effect
- change and continuity
- citizenship
- community
- diversity
- identity and belonging
- interconnectedness
- justice and equality
- responsibility
- rights
- social action.

#### Therefore, Social Studies is about:

- understanding the various dimensions under which human societies have, and can be, understood and explained such as the personal, the local, the national, the international
- understanding the various social issues that exist in Wales and internationally
- appreciating that social issues are complex and can be explained from various perspectives
- understanding that societies change, what causes those changes and what we as members of society can do to promote change in our society through legal, non-violent social action.

### 1.2 Curriculum for Wales

This GCSE Social Studies qualification is underpinned by the Curriculum for Wales framework and has been designed to ensure that learners can continue to make progress towards the four purposes whilst studying for this qualification. Central to this design are the [principles of progression,](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/humanities/principles-of-progression/) along with the [statements of what](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/humanities/statements-of-what-matters/)  [matters](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/humanities/statements-of-what-matters/) and those [subject specific skills and concepts](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/humanities/designing-your-curriculum/#specific-considerations-for-this-area) outlined in the '[Designing your](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/humanities/designing-your-curriculum/)  [Curriculum](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/humanities/designing-your-curriculum/)' section of the Humanities Area of Learning and Experiences.

In developing this qualification, we have considered where there are opportunities to embed the cross-curricular themes and where there are opportunities for integral skills and cross-curricular skills to be developed. Appendix A provides a simple mapping, and information to support teachers will be provided in the Guidance for Teaching.

We have also considered where the qualification can generate opportunities for integrating the learning experiences noted in 'Opportunities for integration of learning experiences' on page 29; the Guidance for Teaching will include further information on integrating these learning experiences into delivery.

The GCSE Social Studies qualification supports the Curriculum for Wales by:

- supporting the statements of what matters[1](#page-7-1) by encouraging learners to:
  - ask increasingly sophisticated enquiry questions
  - demonstrate greater independence in finding suitable information, making informed predictions and hypotheses, and making judgements
  - become more able to effectively work with others, especially, but not limited to, taking part in social action
  - increase their breadth and depth of knowledge and underlying concepts
  - develop an understanding of themselves in the world
  - demonstrate an ability to work with an increasing number and sophistication of sources of information, and a growing understanding of how to resolve contradictory or conflicting accounts
  - continually refine and develop a growing sophistication of key disciplinary skills, including those relating to enquiry such as framing questions and using evidence to construct and support an answer, and relating that to representation and interpretation of enquiry results
  - demonstrate a growing ability to transfer existing skills and knowledge into new, and increasingly unfamiliar contexts
  - demonstrate a greater ability to influence events by exercising informed and responsible citizenship.
- supporting the subject specific considerations for Social Studie[s](#page-7-2)<sup>2</sup> by:
  - developing an understanding of the discipline and its value
  - encouraging conceptual understanding of the world by learning about people and their values, in different times, places and circumstances
  - providing rich contexts to explore social issues, identity, rights and responsibilities, and social organisation
  - encouraging active participation and engagement with social issues through social enquiry, discussions and social action
  - developing an understanding of how systems of government in Wales operate and affect people's lives, and how they compare with other systems
  - exploring the concepts of governance, rights, equality, inequality, ethnicity, gender and poverty.

<span id="page-8-0"></span>

### 1.3 Prior learning and progression

Although there is no specific requirement for prior learning, the qualification is designed primarily for learners between the ages of 14 and 16 and builds on the conceptual understanding learners have developed through their learning from ages 3 –14.

The qualification allows learners to develop a strong foundation of knowledge, skills and understanding which supports progression to post-16 study and prepares learners for life, learning and work. The qualification provides a suitable foundation for the study of Government and Politics, Law, Psychology and Sociology at either AS or A level. In addition, the specification provides a coherent, satisfying and worthwhile course of study for learners who do not progress to further study in this subject.

<span id="page-8-1"></span>

### 1.4 Guided learning hours

GCSE Social Studies has been designed to be delivered within 120–140 guided learning hours. The qualification has been primarily designed as a 2-year programme for learners in years 10 and 11.

<span id="page-8-2"></span>

### 1.5 Use of language

As our understanding of diversity, equity, and inclusion evolves, so must our language. Updated terminology better reflects individual identities and fosters respect and accuracy. Language used should be specific as possible. Staying informed and adaptable is crucial, as inclusive language promotes dignity and equity. Recognising that language will continue to evolve, we will remain open to further amendments to ensure it accurately represents and supports all individuals. WJEC will inform centres of any amendments and the most up to date version of the specification will always be on the website.

<span id="page-8-3"></span>

### 1.6 Equality and fair access

The specification may be followed by any learner, irrespective of gender, ethnic, religious or cultural background. It has been designed to avoid, where possible, features that could, without justification, make it more difficult for a learner to access and achieve because they have a particular protected characteristic.

The protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010 are age, disability, gender reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and sexual orientation.

Access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are made for eligible learners to enable them to access the assessments and demonstrate their knowledge and skills without changing the demands of the assessment.

Information on access arrangements and reasonable adjustments is found in the following document from the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ): Access Arrangements, Reasonable Adjustments: General and Vocational Qualifications. This document is available on the JCQ website [\(www.jcq.org.uk\)](http://www.jcq.org.uk/).

We will be following the principles set out in this document and, as a consequence of provision for reasonable adjustments, very few learners will encounter a complete barrier to any part of the assessment.

## 2 SUBJECT CONTENT

<span id="page-9-1"></span>

### How to read the amplification

The amplification provided in the right-hand column uses the following four stems:

- 'Learners should be aware of' is used when learners do not need to understand all aspects of the specified content in detail. Teachers should refer to Guidance for Teaching documents for further guidance on the depth and breadth to which this content should be taught.
- 'Learners should know' is used when learners are required to demonstrate basic knowledge and understanding.
- 'Learners should understand' is used when learners are required to demonstrate greater depth of knowledge and understanding, application of knowledge to familiar or unfamiliar contexts and analysis and evaluation of information for a given purpose.
- 'Learners should be able to' is used when learners need to apply their knowledge and understanding to a practical situation or demonstrate application of practical skills and techniques.

The use of the word 'including' indicates that the specified content must be taught and could be subject to assessment.

The use of the words 'for example' or 'such as' indicates that the specified content is for guidance only, and alternative examples could be chosen.

## Unit 1

### Society and Social Issues

Written examination 30% of qualification 60 marks

### Overview of unit

This unit is focused on introducing learners to the idea of society and what this means, and how this can be explored through various concepts and levels, for example the local, national and international.

The purpose of this unit is to explore:

- a variety of ways that societies can be explained and understood
- how societies' norms and values are transmitted and maintained through socialisation
- the ideas of identity, rights, responsibilities and diversity within society
- social institutions and various levels of governance in Wales, the United Kingdom and the wider world that influence how societies function
- social issues, examining how they are explained, measured and caused, the groups affected by them and their impact on individuals.

## Opportunities for integration of learning experiences

GCSE Social Studies generates opportunities for the following learning experiences to be developed (experiences will not be directly assessed):

- develop empathy, tolerance, and compassion through the study of different and diverse contexts and perspectives
- develop confidence in articulating and reflecting on their own views, understanding their capacity to change
- consider their rights and how these rights can be exercised, constrained, and defended
- engage in collaborative working.

The Guidance for Teaching will include further information on the opportunities provided by the qualification for teachers/centres to integrate these learning experiences and skills into delivery.

For opportunities to develop cross-cutting themes, cross-curricular skills and integral skills please see Appendix A.

### 3.2 Arrangements for non-examination assessment

#### Unit 2: Overview

The assignment, which includes data sources and several tasks, will be issued to centres in an Assessment Pack via the WJEC Portal in the September of the first year. Tasks are not intended to change for the lifetime of the qualification. The social issue will change annually. Centres have the flexibility to decide when during the year learners undertake the assignment. However, it is important that centres use the data sources from the year that they plan to submit the work for marking as this may be different to the year that the candidates undertake the assessment.

This assessment contributes to 20% of the overall qualification grade and will take 6 hours 30 minutes for candidates to complete the tasks. The assignment could be completed in one sitting, or in multiple, shorter sessions. The tasks will be marked out of a total of 60 marks.

This unit will be assessed through an externally set assignment and will be set and marked by WJEC. Assessments must be submitted digitally (they may be handwritten and scanned or completed digitally).

#### Unit 4: Overview

For this assessment learners are required to consider how they could plan for social action on a social issue that affects a community.

The assignment, which will include a brief and several tasks will be issued to centres in an Assessment pack via the WJEC Portal. Tasks are not intended to change for the lifetime of the qualification. If candidates choose to resit this unit at a later date, they must choose another social issue and social action to explore. Centres have the flexibility to decide when, during the assessment year, learners undertake the assignment.

This assessment contributes to 20% of the overall qualification grade and will take 6 hours and 30 minutes to complete. The assignment could be completed in one sitting, or in multiple, shorter sessions. The assignment will be marked out of a total of 60 marks.

This unit will be assessed through an externally set assignment and will be marked by the centre and moderated by WJEC. Assessments must be submitted digitally (they may be handwritten and scanned or completed digitally).

## 4 MALPRACTICE

Before the course starts, the teacher is responsible for informing candidates of WJEC's regulations concerning malpractice. Candidates must not take part in any unfair practice in the preparation of work for GCSE Social Studies.

Information regarding malpractice is available in our [Guide to preventing, reporting and](https://www.wjec.co.uk/media/0pjats1l/guide-to-preventing-reporting-and-investigating-malpractice-april-2022-002.pdf)  [investigating malpractice.](https://www.wjec.co.uk/media/0pjats1l/guide-to-preventing-reporting-and-investigating-malpractice-april-2022-002.pdf)

All cases of suspected or actual malpractice must be reported immediately to WJEC (malpractice@wjec.co.uk). If candidates commit malpractice, they may be penalised or disqualified from the examinations.

In all cases of malpractice, centres are advised to consult the JCQ booklet [Suspected](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice)  [Malpractice: Policies and Procedures.](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice)

## 5 TECHNICAL INFORMATION

<span id="page-34-1"></span>

### 5.1 Entries and awards

This is a unitised qualification. Learners are entered for each unit separately.

Assessment opportunities will be available in the summer assessment period each year, until the end of the life of the specification.

Unit 1, Unit 2 and Unit 3 will be available in 2027 (and each year thereafter). Unit 4 will be available in 2028 (and each year thereafter) and the qualification will be awarded for the first time in summer 2028.

Pre-16 candidates (i.e. candidates who are under 16 on 31st August in the academic year in which they were entered)

The terminal rule is set at 40% of the overall qualification for GCSE Social Studies.

If the assessment being re-taken contributes to the 40% terminal rule requirement, the mark for the new assessment will count regardless of previous results in that assessment.

Candidates may resit an individual unit once only. The better uniform mark score from the two attempts will be used in calculating the final overall grade subject to the terminal rule being satisfied first i.e. that candidates must complete a minimum amount of the assessment for a qualification in the series in which they are cashingin.

If any unit has been attempted twice and a candidate wishes to enter the unit for the third time, the candidate will have to re-enter all units and the appropriate cash-in(s). This is referred to as a 'fresh start'. When retaking a qualification (fresh start), a candidate may have up to two attempts at each unit. However, no results from examination units taken prior to the fresh start can be used in aggregating the new grade(s).

If a candidate has been entered for but is absent for a unit, the absence does not count as an attempt. The candidate would, however, qualify as a resit candidate in the final resit series.

Marks for non-examination assessment may be used for the life of the specification.

Post-16 Candidates (i.e. candidates who are 16 or over on 1st September in the academic year in which they are entered)

There is no terminal rule that applies to Post-16 Candidates for GCSE Social Studies.

There is no limit on the number of times a candidate can resit an individual unit; however, the better uniform mark score from the most two recent attempts will be used in calculating the final overall grade.

The 'fresh start' rule does not apply to post-16 candidates.

{36}------------------------------------------------

If a candidate has been entered for but is absent for a unit, the absence does not count as an attempt. The candidate would, however, qualify as a resit candidate in the final resit series.

Marks for non-examination assessment may be used for the life of the specification.

The entry codes appear below.
