0,3,c,| Candidate Assessment Pack | **c**,ErrorCategory.FACTUAL_INACCURACY,95,"The character 'c' is not a valid page number in the context of a table of contents, indicating an error in the content or an OCR misinterpretation of a number."
1,6,semi-autobiographic,"This film is based on the **semi-autobiographic** novel of Judith Kerr and explores the themes of escape, the rise of the National Socialist Party of Germany, persecution, antisemitism and discrimination.",ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,98,The correct adjective form is 'semi-autobiographical' when referring to a novel that is partly autobiographical.
2,6,German,This film is about a Turkish family who come to **German** as guest workers in the 1960's.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,"The context requires the name of the country, 'Germany', not the language or nationality, 'German'."
3,7,non-examination,This is a WJEC marked (external) **non-examination** assessment.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,Compound adjective 'non-examination' is typically hyphenated in British English for clarity.
4,7,internet,"Where tasks are produced digitally, online dictionaries, spelling and grammar checking programmes and access to **internet** must be disabled.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,'Internet' is a proper noun and should be capitalised.
5,8,declaration form,Centres must keep a record of the date on which the assessment is conducted including the name of the work studied on the Candidate and Centre **declaration form** below.,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"The term 'Candidate and Centre Declaration Form' is capitalised elsewhere in the document, indicating it is a specific document title and should be consistently capitalised."
6,8,outside of,Centres must have in place systems to ensure candidates cannot access evidence they have been developing **outside of** supervised activities.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The phrase 'outside of' is often considered verbose; 'outside' is sufficient and more concise.
7,9,is summarised,The acceptable formats for evidence of each of the tasks **is summarised** in the task tables.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The plural subject 'formats' requires the plural verb 'are summarised' for subject-verb agreement.
8,9,declaration form,Centres must also ensure that candidates complete a candidate **declaration form**; these are included in the candidate assessment pack.,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"The term 'Candidate Declaration Form' is capitalised elsewhere in the document, indicating it is a specific document title and should be consistently capitalised."
9,9,accepted,The form can be completed electronically or manually. Electronic signatures will be **accepted**,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,The sentence is missing a full stop at the end.
10,9,non-examination,You should refer to the JCQ Instructions for conducting **non-examination** assessment for further information on managing assessment within our GCSE Qualifications.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,Compound adjective 'non-examination' is typically hyphenated in British English for clarity.
11,9,Qualifications,You should refer to the JCQ Instructions for conducting non-examination assessment for further information on managing assessment within our GCSE **Qualifications**.,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,88,"'Qualifications' is generally not capitalised in this general context unless it is part of a specific, formal title."
12,12,the kind of help and how much they can give you,"Your teacher is allowed to help you to understand the assessment requirements and the task, but there are rules about **the kind of help and how much they can give you**. You should speak to your teacher if you have any questions about what you are and are not allowed to do as you are completing the tasks, as they will know how much help they are allowed to give you.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The phrasing 'the kind of help and how much they can give you' is slightly awkward; 'the kind and amount of help' or 'the kind of help and the extent to which they can give it' would be more concise.
13,12,how much help they are allowed to give you,"You should speak to your teacher if you have any questions about what you are and are not allowed to do as you are completing the tasks, as they will know **how much help they are allowed to give you**.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,"The phrase 'how much help they are allowed to give you' is repeated shortly after a similar construction, leading to slight redundancy."
14,12,candidates and the work produced,It is important that you work independently from other candidates **and the work produced should be your own unaided work**.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,A comma is typically used before 'and' when it joins two independent clauses for improved readability in formal writing.
15,13,access to internet,"Where tasks are produced digitally, online dictionaries, spelling and grammar checking programmes and **access to internet** must be disabled.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,The definite article 'the' is required before 'internet' in this context.
16,14,non[examination assessments],The following information has been taken from the [JCQ Information for candidates](https://www.jcq.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IFC-NE_Assessments_2021_v4.pdf) – **non[examination assessments]** and the [JCQ Artificial Intelligence (AI) Use in Assessments:,ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,95,The compound adjective 'non-examination' requires a hyphen for correct British English spelling.
17,14,specialists they,"Markers are highly experienced subject **specialists they** may have read the source you are using, or even marked the work you have copied from!",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,This is a comma splice; two independent clauses are joined without proper punctuation or a conjunction. A semicolon or full stop is needed.
18,15,:<br>any,References: Give details of the exact source of<br>**:<br>any** non-original material used in the assignment.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,90,"The colon is misplaced and separated by a line break, creating an awkward and grammatically incorrect sentence structure. It should follow 'source of'."
19,15,Artificial<br>Intelligence,I have clearly referenced any sources and any **Artificial<br>Intelligence** tools used in the work. I understand that false declaration is a form of malpractice.,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"For consistency with the capitalisation used on page 14 ('JCQ Artificial Intelligence (AI) Use in Assessments'), 'Artificial Intelligence' should be capitalised here."
20,15,"must, retain","For example: ChatGPT 3.5 [(https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/)](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/), 25/01/2023. You **must, retain** a copy of the question(s) and computer-generated content for reference and authentication purposes, in a noneditable format (such as a screenshot) and provide a brief explanation of how it has been used.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,The comma after 'must' is superfluous and grammatically incorrect.
21,16,Supervisors Signature,Supervisors<br>**Signature**:,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,The noun 'Supervisors' requires a possessive apostrophe ('Supervisor's') as it refers to the signature belonging to the supervisor.
22,18,band marked,For **band marked** questions mark schemes are in two parts; the indicative content and the assessment grid.,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,The term 'band marked' is inconsistent with the established heading 'Banded mark schemes' and the subsequent use of 'banded mark questions' in the same section. It should be 'banded mark' for consistency.
23,19,matches,"If the descriptors at the lowest band are satisfied, examiners should move up to the next band and repeat this process for each band until the descriptors most closely **matches** the work.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,"Subject-verb agreement error; 'descriptors' is plural, so the verb should be 'match'."
24,19,that,"Marking should be positive, rewarding achievement rather **that** penalising failure or omissions.",ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,95,Common misspelling; 'that' should be 'than' in the comparative phrase 'rather than'.
25,19,standardising,Standardising material that has already been awarded a mark will be provided during **standardising** and this should be used as a reference material when assessing work.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The repetition of 'standardising' as both an adjective and a gerund in close proximity is awkward; 'standardisation' or 'standardisation process' would improve flow.
26,19,is,Examiners are reminded of the need to revisit the standardising material as they apply the mark scheme in order to confirm that the band and the mark allocated **is** appropriate to the work submitted.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,Subject-verb agreement error; the compound subject 'the band and the mark' requires the plural verb 'are'.
27,19,reward as directed,"Where a candidate provides a response that contains aspects or approaches not included in the indicative content, examiners should use their professional judgement to determine the validity of the response in light of the task and **reward as directed** by the bands.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The phrasing is slightly abrupt; adding an object like 'it' or rephrasing to 'and reward it as directed' would improve clarity.
28,20,and or,Incorrect verb forms resulting in confusion about the subject **and<br>or** the tense:,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,'And or' should be 'and/or' to correctly indicate a choice between 'and' and 'or'.
29,20,Mother-tongue,•<br>**Mother-tongue** word swaps:,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,88,'Mother-tongue' should be hyphenated as a compound adjective when preceding a noun in British English.
30,20,the communication,Minor spelling errors which don't affect **the communication**:,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The definite article 'the' is unnecessary here; 'don't affect communication' is more concise and natural.
31,20,don't,Missing Umlaut which **don't**<br>affect the meaning or tense:,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,"Subject-verb agreement error; 'Umlaut' is singular, so the verb should be 'doesn't'."
32,21,longer sentence,"More sophisticated linguistic constructions, which may include:<br>•<br>**longer sentence** with connectives (e.g. because, such as,<br>when…)",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,"For a general description of linguistic constructions, 'longer sentences' (plural) would be more appropriate than 'longer sentence' (singular)."
33,21,example: frequent,"Please note that these should be viewed in conjunction with the descriptor as they may not always go from top to lower, for **example: frequent** errors would be in a lower mark band.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,A comma is required after the introductory phrase 'for example'.
34,23,"used, little complex language","Some appropriate vocabulary and structures are **used, little complex language**.Generally successful use of verb and tense formations.Some accurate language – there may be some minor and major errors.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"This is a comma splice, incorrectly joining two independent clauses without a coordinating conjunction or appropriate punctuation."
35,27,control,Unit 2 **control** the level of supervision is **Direct**. **Please note that this assessment must be taken in one single session and must not exceed the allotted one hour.**,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,"The subject 'Unit 2' is singular, requiring the verb 'controls' for subject-verb agreement."
36,28,Unit 2 control the level of guidance,**Unit 2 control the level of guidance** is Not Permitted. Please see the controls in the table below:,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The subject phrase is poorly constructed and lacks proper grammatical agreement or structure with the verb 'is'.
37,29,Re-drafting,**Re-drafting** is allowed only within the time of the NEA and without teacher feedback.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,"In British English, 'redrafting' as a noun or gerund is typically written as one word without a hyphen."
38,29,to not spend,Candidates should try **to not spend** more or less than the recommended time on a task.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The split infinitive 'to not spend' is generally considered less formal; 'try not to spend' is preferred in formal British English.
