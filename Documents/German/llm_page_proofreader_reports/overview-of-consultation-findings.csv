0,3,have decided,Qualifications Wales **have decided** that these qualifications will be introduced in a phased way; WJEC is now developing the qualifications that are to be available for first teaching from September 2025 to meet these requirements.,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"While 'have decided' is acceptable for a collective noun in British English, 'Qualifications Wales' is treated as a singular entity elsewhere (e.g., 'WJEC is'), making 'has decided' more consistent with the document's style."
1,4,nonexamination,This was particularly prevalent in qualifications where the **nonexamination** assessment is either new or significantly increased.,ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,95,The compound word 'non-examination' requires a hyphen in British English.
2,4,around the concerns,The subject-specific section of the report goes into further detail **around the concerns** raised.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,75,Using 'about' or 'regarding' would be more formal and precise in this context.
3,5,well-being,"Welsh Government's guidance on **well-being**, equity and inclusion describes equity as meaning equitable access to opportunities to perform in assessments, access to the same materials and spaces, unbiased assessment tasks, preventing prejudice or stereotyping and allowing students to access the assessment regardless of their background.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"The term 'wellbeing' is used as a single word elsewhere in the document (page 4), and 'wellbeing' is the preferred British English spelling."
4,5,as meaning,"Welsh Government's guidance on well-being, equity and inclusion describes equity **as meaning** equitable access to opportunities to perform in assessments, access to the same materials and spaces, unbiased assessment tasks, preventing prejudice or stereotyping and allowing students to access the assessment regardless of their background.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The phrase 'as meaning' is redundant; 'describes equity as equitable access' or 'describes equity to mean equitable access' would be more concise.
5,5,nonexamination,"Some stakeholders felt that **nonexamination** assessment can further disadvantage some learners, for example, those who do not have support or access to adequate resources at home.",ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,95,The compound word 'non-examination' requires a hyphen in British English.
6,5,noted that they felt that,"Respondents **noted that they felt that** appropriate controls should be in place to ensure that all schools assess fairly, or there could be a lack of confidence in qualification results which would consequently mean learner attainment would have less value associated with it.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The phrasing is wordy; 'noted that appropriate controls' or 'felt that appropriate controls' would be more concise.
7,5,maximalise,"However, one stakeholder group had a different view on what impacted equity, requesting that the GCSEs have a range of assessment methods, focusing on competency-based continuous assessment methods, rather than coursework or mini-tests, to **maximalise** equity.",ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,98,The correct British English spelling is 'maximise'.
8,5,Qualification Wales,"When we submit our qualifications to **Qualification Wales** for approval, we must stipulate how we have managed the balance of manageability, engagement, reliability and validity.",ErrorCategory.FACTUAL_INACCURACY,99,"The proper noun is 'Qualifications Wales' (plural), as used consistently elsewhere in the document."
9,6,nonexamination,"Where this is the case, scanning and uploading of **nonexamination** assessment could be time-consuming, particularly when considering the scale of non-examination assessment across the suite of qualifications.",ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,95,The compound word 'non-examination' requires a hyphen in British English.
10,7,does not refer,"...where the word does not add value or the Approval Criteria **does not refer** to concepts, we have removed the references.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,90,"'Criteria' is a plural noun, therefore the verb should be 'do not refer' to maintain subject-verb agreement, as per British English grammar conventions (OED, Collins)."
11,8,"However, we have asked","...to retain the current flexibility. **However, we have asked** our specification writers and reviewers to be mindful of learner workload when developing the content of the portfolio.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The repeated use of 'However' in close proximity is repetitive and could be varied for better flow and readability.
12,8,which must be set,...30% of the qualification must be assessed by digital-only external examination **which must be set** and marked by the awarding body.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,"For a restrictive clause defining the type of examination, 'that' is generally preferred over 'which' in formal British English when no comma precedes it."
13,9,states,The Approval Criteria **states** that 30% of the qualification must be assessed by external examination which must include questions on unprepared works.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,90,"'Criteria' is a plural noun, therefore the verb should be 'state' to maintain subject-verb agreement. This is inconsistent with other correct uses of 'Approval Criteria' in the document."
14,9,which must include,The Approval Criteria states that 30% of the qualification must be assessed by external examination **which must include** questions on unprepared works.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,"For a restrictive clause defining the type of examination, 'that' is generally preferred over 'which' in formal British English when no comma precedes it."
15,9,anytime,...stipulating that both the performing and composing units could be assessed **anytime** during the course,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,"In formal British English, 'any time' (two words) is generally preferred when referring to 'at any point in time'."
16,9,which must be set,...35% of the qualification must be assessed by digital-only external examination **which must be set** and marked by the awarding body.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,"For a restrictive clause defining the type of examination, 'that' is generally preferred over 'which' in formal British English when no comma precedes it."
17,10,that the assessment approach is appropriate,"Respondents generally agreed or partially agreed that the proposed assessment approach is appropriate, that the unit purposes are appropriate and engaging for learners and meet the qualification purpose and aims, and **that the assessment approach is appropriate**.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The clause 'that the assessment approach is appropriate' is repeated unnecessarily within the same sentence, creating redundancy."
18,13,was manageable,Respondents generally agreed or partially agreed that the proposed qualification structure and assessment approach is appropriate and that the proposed qualification **was manageable** for learners.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The past tense 'was manageable' is inconsistent with 'is appropriate' when referring to a currently proposed qualification; 'is manageable' would be consistent.
19,13,on non-religious,This was not the intention – the qualification will place equal value on religious and **on non-religious** beliefs and philosophical convictions.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The second 'on' is redundant; 'on religious and non-religious beliefs' is more concise and natural.
20,13,in relation to the amount,Some concerns were raised about the amount of content to cover **in relation to the amount** of teaching time.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,'In relation to' is wordy; 'relative to' or 'compared to' would be more concise.
21,13,outline with some respondents,Some concerns were raised about the reference to concepts in our **outline with some respondents** stating that our diagrams were confusing.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,A comma is needed to separate the main clause from the participial phrase for improved clarity and readability.
22,14,i.e. human rights,"Relating to the specific units, some respondents felt there were repeated topics **i.e. human rights**, with some respondents questioning why a religious studies qualification was teaching human rights.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,'I.e.' (that is) is used incorrectly; 'e.g.' (for example) or 'such as' would be more appropriate here as it introduces an example.
23,14,nonreligious beliefs,"Unit 3 – Human experience and the world focuses on how environmental issues are approached by people with different religious and/or **nonreligious beliefs**, whereas, Unit 4 – Human rights focuses on ethical/moral, human rights issues from religious and non-religious perspectives.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"The term 'non-religious' is hyphenated elsewhere in the document (e.g., page 13); consistency requires hyphenation here."
24,14,"ethical/moral, human rights issues","Unit 4 – Human rights focuses on **ethical/moral, human rights issues** from religious and non-religious perspectives.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The comma after 'ethical/moral' is misplaced; 'ethical/moral human rights issues' functions as a compound adjective.
25,14,in relation to the links,We also received positive feedback **in relation to the links** to natural resources and the environment.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,'In relation to' is wordy; 'regarding' or 'concerning' would be more concise.
26,15,text and media,"It will validly secure the requirements of the Approval Criteria that learners must develop their skills from reading a variety of **text and media**, understand and interpret their meaning and message and allow them to further explore ""Cymraeg and me"", whilst building on the skills and knowledge developed as part of the Core Cymraeg qualification.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,'Text' should be plural ('texts') to agree with 'a variety of' when paired with the plural 'media'.
27,15,use of the language in a spontaneous and confident manner,- the emphasis on understanding and **use of the language in a spontaneous and confident manner**,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The phrasing is awkward; 'spontaneous and confident use of the language' is more natural and concise.
28,15,for the number of teaching hours,Some respondents expressed concern about the potential amount of content to be covered **for the number of teaching hours** available.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,'For the number of' is less precise; 'given the number of' or 'relative to the number of' would be more appropriate.
29,16,represent,Our specification writer for this unit is aware of the concerns and we will aim to include writing that **represent** a variety of perspectives reflecting the diverse nature of Welsh citizenship and its cultures in order to make the unit interesting and relevant to learners.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The subject 'writing' is singular, so the verb should be 'represents' for subject-verb agreement."
30,16,nonexamination assessment,the Approval Criteria states that 50% of the qualification will be assessed through **nonexamination assessment** and marked by the centre.,ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,90,The compound adjective 'non-examination' requires a hyphen in British English.
31,16,being from,"WJEC received 47 responses, with over half of those **being from** practitioners within a school.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The phrase 'being from' can be more concisely written as 'from'.
32,16,people in the wider world,"the opportunity to emphasise Welsh culture, history, and **people in the wider world**.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The phrasing 'people in the wider world' is slightly awkward; 'people from the wider world' or 'people and their place in the wider world' would be clearer.
33,17,more of an authentic,"This amendment will allow the translanguaging task to be **more of an authentic** and engaging task for learners, to better prepare learners for the world of work and beyond.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The phrase 'more of an authentic' can be more concisely written as 'more authentic'.
34,17,in the time,Our specification writers are being guided on the number of Guided Learning Hours per unit to ensure that the content is teachable **in the time**.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The phrase 'in the time' is vague; 'within the time available' or 'in the allocated time' would be more precise.
35,17,set text,"In response, we are exploring opportunities to add **set text** to Unit 2 and Unit 4.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"Given the context of 'a variety of literary works' and 'opportunities to add', 'set texts' (plural) is required."
36,17,whilst,"This would help ensure the study of a range of literature **whilst** promoting flexibility and choice for centres in terms of topics, themes, and diversity.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,75,"While 'whilst' is grammatically correct, 'while' is generally preferred in modern British English for conciseness."
37,17,the majority of those indicating that they were a teacher,"WJEC received 164 responses, with half of the respondents answering on behalf of a school, **the majority of those indicating that they were a teacher**.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The phrasing is clunky; 'most of whom were teachers' or 'the majority indicating they were teachers' would be more concise and fluent.
38,17,Single and Double award,"Some respondents were not in agreement with the combined Language and Literature approach, the organisation into **Single and Double award**, or the reduction to two assessment objectives.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"When referring to both 'Single' and 'Double' types, 'award' should be plural ('awards')."
39,18,which we consider to be a broad range,"For Unit 2, we are offering a longlist of around 40 narrative fictional prose texts **which we consider to be a broad range** from which centres can choose.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The phrase 'to be' is often superfluous in such constructions; 'which we consider a broad range' is more concise.
40,18,nonexamination assessment tasks,Learners will be allowed and encouraged to supplement the anthology texts with their own selections when preparing for the **nonexamination assessment tasks** in Units 3 and 5.,ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,90,"The compound adjective 'non-examination' requires a hyphen in British English, as consistently used elsewhere in the document."
41,18,not one unit focuses solely on oracy,"As a direct result of this feedback, we have redesigned some of the units so that **not one unit focuses solely on oracy**.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The phrasing is slightly awkward; 'no single unit focuses solely on oracy' or 'no unit focuses solely on oracy' would be clearer.
42,18,utilise,"We believe this will lead to oracy assessments being conducted in more manageable batches that allow learners to **utilise** their knowledge and skills from the whole unit, rather than having an entire unit assessed only via oracy tasks.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,75,"In British English, 'use' is generally preferred over 'utilise' for conciseness unless a specific nuance of 'making practical use of' is intended."
43,18,double award unit,Assessments based on poetry feature once in the common units and once in a discrete **double award unit**.,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"For consistency with 'Single Award' and 'Double Award' as proper nouns for qualifications, 'Double Award unit' should be capitalised."
44,18,Unit 1 and Unit 3 requires,The current GCSE English Literature qualification requires the assessment of poetry in two units: the comparison of two unseen poems in Unit 1 **and Unit 3 requires** the comparison of two poems from fifteen specified poems listed for study.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,90,"This sentence is a run-on with two distinct clauses ('the comparison of two unseen poems in Unit 1' and 'Unit 3 requires...') that are not properly coordinated or separated, leading to poor structure."
45,18,providing a textual analysis,This means that learners will have the opportunity to use the studied poetry as a vehicle for discussing how attitudes have changed over time – addressing AO2 – rather than **providing a textual analysis** (AO1).,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The verb 'providing' is slightly weak here; 'performing a textual analysis' or simply 'textual analysis' would be more direct.
46,18,over the inclusion,Questions were raised **over the inclusion** of a Shakespeare text.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,"In formal writing, 'about' is generally preferred over 'over' when referring to a topic of discussion."
47,18,were considered,"The length of the examinations for Units 1, 4 and 6 **were considered** by some respondents to be too long.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The subject 'length' is singular, so the verb should be 'was considered' for subject-verb agreement."
48,19,high frequency and high utility,"Some respondents noted that they were pleased to see relevant broad themes, inclusion of cultural and societal awareness in the countries of the assessed languages, the use of **high frequency and high utility** grammar and core vocabulary, an extensive and comprehensive list of grammar and a more skills-centred approach.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,90,"Compound adjectives modifying 'grammar' should be hyphenated (e.g., 'high-frequency' and 'high-utility') for clarity in British English."
49,19,equally split response,We asked stakeholders for their preference for a 4- or 5-unit structure and received an **equally split response**.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,90,The compound adjective 'equally split' should be hyphenated when preceding a noun ('equally-split response') for clarity in British English.
50,19,Taking into regard,"**Taking into regard** all comments from the consultation, there was concern that five units may put learners off from opting for a language and that it would appear to be more challenging than other subjects.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,95,The correct idiom is 'taking into account' or 'having regard to'; 'taking into regard' is an awkward phrasing.
51,19,non-examination assessments,- Some concerns were raised around the number of **non-examination assessments**. We are unable to address these points as they reflect decisions made by Qualifications Wales; the Approval Criteria state that a total of between 45–50% of the qualification must be assessed through non-examination assessment tasks that are set by the awarding body and marked by the awarding body.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,90,The compound adjective 'non-examination' should be hyphenated when preceding a noun ('non-examination assessments') for clarity in British English.

53,19,non-tiering,- Some responses in the consultation referred to **non-tiering** impacting learner confidence and take up.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,90,The prefix 'non-' typically takes a hyphen when forming a compound adjective ('non-tiering') in British English.
54,19,take up,- Some responses in the consultation referred to non-tiering impacting learner confidence and **take up**.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,90,"As a noun, 'take-up' should be hyphenated in British English."
55,19,sub-sub themes,"There was some concern regarding the number of themes (the current spec has 3 broad themes, 8 sub-themes and 18 **sub-sub themes**).",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,90,The compound term 'sub-sub-themes' should be hyphenated for clarity in British English.

Qualifications Wales **have announced** that a Single Award GCSE Science qualification will be available for first teaching in 2026, a year after the Double Award qualification is available.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"'Qualifications Wales' is a singular entity, therefore the verb should be 'has announced' for subject-verb agreement."
