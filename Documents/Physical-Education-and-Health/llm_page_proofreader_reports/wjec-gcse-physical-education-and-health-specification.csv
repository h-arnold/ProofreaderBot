## 1.2 Curriculum for Wales

This GCSE Physical Education and Health qualification is underpinned by the Curriculum for Wales framework and has been designed to ensure that learners can continue to make progress towards the four purposes whilst studying for this qualification. Central to this design are the [principles of progression,](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/health-and-well-being/principles-of-progression/) along with the [statements of what matters](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/health-and-well-being/statements-of-what-matters/) and those [subject specific skills and concepts](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/health-and-well-being/designing-your-curriculum/#specific-considerations-for-this-area) outlined in the '[Designing your Curriculum](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/health-and-well-being/designing-your-curriculum/)' section of the Health and **Well-being** Area of Learning and Experiences",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"The term 'wellbeing' is used as a single word in bullet points but hyphenated as 'Well-being' in the formal title 'Health and Well-being Area of Learning and Experiences' on the same page, indicating an inconsistency in preferred spelling."
5,6,subject specific skills,"Central to this design are the [principles of progression,](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/health-and-well-being/principles-of-progression/) along with the [statements of what matters](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/health-and-well-being/statements-of-what-matters/) and those **subject specific skills** and concepts outlined in the '[Designing your Curriculum](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/health-and-well-being/designing-your-curriculum/)' section of the Health and Well-being Area of Learning and Experiences",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,"When 'subject-specific' acts as a compound adjective modifying 'skills', it should be hyphenated for clarity and adherence to British English stylistic conventions (e.g., 'subject-specific skills')."

It should likely be a comma and a rephrasing (e.g., '...including health-promoting behaviours, and develop positive...')."
7,7,health: resulting in,develop their independence and agency in matters relating to physical education and **health: resulting in** a growing responsibility for their own health and well-being,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,A comma or em-dash would be more appropriate than a colon to introduce a participial phrase describing a consequence.

9,7,others; becoming more socially responsible.,transfer understanding from their own well-being to that of **others; becoming more socially responsible.**,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"A semicolon is used to separate independent clauses or complex list items.
