<span id="page-5-0"></span>

# 1 INTRODUCTION

<span id="page-5-1"></span>

## 1.1 Aims

GCSE Physical Education and Health supports learners to:

- develop their knowledge and understanding of health, wellbeing, and physical activity and the links between them
- understand the factors that impact on levels of activity and the relationship with physical, social and emotional health and wellbeing through the life cycle
- understand the socio-cultural influences on participation, and contemporary developments within sport and physical activity, on a local, national and international stage
- perform effectively in different sports and physical activities by developing skills and techniques, and selecting and using tactics, strategies and/or compositional ideas
- analyse physical performance and select appropriate strategies and interventions for development and improvement
- think critically and reflectively about their own performance and practice, and that of others
- explore the cross-cutting theme of human rights and diversity, including Black, Asian and minority ethnic perspectives, identity, culture, contributions and experiences.

These aims are set out in Qualifications Wales's Approval Criteria.

<span id="page-5-2"></span>

## 1.2 Curriculum for Wales

This GCSE Physical Education and Health qualification is underpinned by the Curriculum for Wales framework and has been designed to ensure that learners can continue to make progress towards the four purposes whilst studying for this qualification. Central to this design are the [principles of progression,](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/health-and-well-being/principles-of-progression/) along with the [statements of what matters](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/health-and-well-being/statements-of-what-matters/) and those [subject specific skills and concepts](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/health-and-well-being/designing-your-curriculum/#specific-considerations-for-this-area) outlined in the '[Designing your Curriculum](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/health-and-well-being/designing-your-curriculum/)' section of the Health and Well-being Area of Learning and Experiences

In developing this qualification, we have considered where there are opportunities to embed the cross-curricular themes and where there are opportunities for integral skills and cross-curricular skills to be developed. Appendix B provides a simple mapping, and information to support teachers will be provided in the Guidance for Teaching.

We have also considered where the qualification can generate opportunities for integrating the learning experiences noted on page 22; the Guidance for Teaching will include further information on integrating these learning experiences into delivery. 

{7}------------------------------------------------

The GCSE Physical Education and Health qualification supports the Curriculum for Wales by:

- supporting the statements of what matter[s](#page-6-0)<sup>1</sup> by giving learners the opportunity to:
  - understand the factors that affect physical health and well-being including. health-promoting behaviours develop positive, informed behaviours that encourage them both to care for and respect themselves and others. These behaviours support learners' sense of self-worth, their overall mood and energy levels
  - develop the confidence, motivation, physical competence, knowledge and understanding that can help them lead healthy and active lifestyles which promote good physical health and well-being
  - understand how decisions and actions impact on themselves, on others and on wider society, both now and in the future. It can also help learners understand the factors that influence decision-making, thus placing them in a better position to make more informed and considered decisions
  - develop the critical-thinking skills necessary to consider their decision-making in terms of possible implications
  - understand the important role of social influences on their lives.
- supporting the principles of progression[2](#page-6-1) by encouraging learners to:
  - revisit and deepen learning in concepts within the statements of what matters across a wide range of topics and aspects of physical education and health
  - develop their independence and agency in matters relating to physical education and health: resulting in a growing responsibility for their own health and well-being
  - develop their ability to make, justify and evaluate decisions
  - develop conceptual knowledge and critical understanding in a range of aspects of physical education and health
  - develop practical skills increasing accuracy and proficiency
  - transfer understanding from their own well-being to that of others; becoming more socially responsible.

{8}------------------------------------------------

- supporting the subject specific considerations for GCSE Physical Education and Health[3](#page-7-0) by providing opportunities for learners to:
  - participate in physical activity and engage in a variety of roles, responsibilities and environments
  - understand what factors, influences and behaviours shape physical health
  - consider what decisions influence their health and well-being and that of others
  - understand the benefits of physical activity, including social, recreational and performance aspects, as well as how it supports their physical health and well-being
  - participate in various sports and activities to support the development and refinement of gross and fine motor skills, transferable skills and the ability to connect progress with perseverance and confidence
  - understand how factors can influence their health and well-being, develop the skills to support healthy behaviours relating to these factors, and the confidence and motivation to support those behaviours for life
  - explore the factors that impact on their mental health and well-being, these may include, but are not limited to, the importance of regular exercise and the effect of a balanced diet
  - reflect on the short-term, medium-term and long-term implications of the decisions they make, and the impact of decisions not only on oneself, but on other people and wider society
  - participate in a range of team and individual sports to support their understanding and application of positive health behaviours. This also supports the development of team-working, resilience and individual confidence. A study of sport can also unlock aspects of social history, politics, geography and science in Wales and across the world.

## 1.3 Prior learning and progression

Although there is no specific requirement for prior learning, the qualification is designed primarily for learners between the ages of 14 and 16 and builds on the conceptual understanding learners have developed through their learning from ages 3 – 14.

The qualification allows learners to develop a strong foundation of knowledge, skills and understanding which supports progression to post-16 study and prepares learners for life, learning and work. The qualification provides a suitable foundation for the study of Physical Education at either AS or A level. In addition, the specification provides a coherent, satisfying and worthwhile course of study for learners who do not progress to further study in this subject.

<span id="page-8-1"></span>

## 1.4 Guided learning hours

GCSE Physical Education and Health has been designed to be delivered within 120 – 140 guided learning hours. The qualification has been primarily designed as a 2 year programme for learners in years 10 and 11.

<span id="page-8-2"></span>

## 1.5 Use of language

As our understanding of diversity, equity, and inclusion evolves, so must our language. Updated terminology better reflects individual identities and fosters respect and accuracy. Language used should be specific as possible. Staying informed and adaptable is crucial, as inclusive language promotes dignity and equity. Recognising that language will continue to evolve, we will remain open to further amendments to ensure it accurately represents and supports all individuals. WJEC will inform centres of any amendments and the most up to date version of the specification will always be on the website.

<span id="page-8-3"></span>

## 1.6 Equality and fair access

The specification may be followed by any learner, irrespective of gender, ethnic, religious or cultural background. It has been designed to avoid, where possible, features that could, without justification, make it more difficult for a learner to access and achieve because they have a particular protected characteristic.

The protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010 are age, disability, gender reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and sexual orientation.

Access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are made for eligible learners to enable them to access the assessments and demonstrate their knowledge and skills without changing the demands of the assessment.

Information on access arrangements and reasonable adjustments is found in the following document from the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ): Access Arrangements, Reasonable Adjustments: General and Vocational Qualifications. This document is available on the JCQ website [\(www.jcq.org.uk\)](http://www.jcq.org.uk/).

We will be following the principles set out in this document and, as a consequence of provision for reasonable adjustments, very few learners will encounter a complete barrier to any part of the assessment.

# 2 SUBJECT CONTENT

<span id="page-9-1"></span>

## How to read the amplification

The amplification provided in the right-hand column uses the following four stems:

- 'Learners should know' is used when learners are required to demonstrate knowledge and understanding.
- 'Learners should understand' is used when learners are required to demonstrate greater depth of knowledge and understanding, application of knowledge to familiar or unfamiliar contexts and analysis and evaluation of information for a given purpose.
- 'Learners should be able to' is used when learners need to apply their knowledge, understanding, analysis and evaluation to a practical situation or demonstrate application of practical skills and techniques.
- 'Learners should be aware of' is used when learners do not need to understand all aspects of the specified content in detail. Teachers should refer to Guidance for Teaching documents for further guidance on the depth and breadth to which this content should be taught.

The use of the word 'including' indicates that the specified content must be taught and could be subject to assessment.

The use of the word 'for example' indicates that the specified content is for guidance only, and alternative examples could be chosen.

Non-examination assessment 60% of qualification:

- 20% Performance 1
- 20% Performance 2 **or** Coaching
- 20% Personal Training (of self)

Internally assessed by the centre, externally moderated by a visiting moderator

## Overview of unit

The purpose of this unit is to:

- demonstrate an awareness and understanding of the range of skills and techniques required for sport and physical activity
- demonstrate application of tactics, strategies and/or compositional ideas within the context of the full activity
- demonstrate application of the skills and principles of planning, organising, communicating and reflecting
- demonstrate confidence, resilience, creativity, effectiveness and efficiency when performing (including coaching) and training.

## This unit will focus on:

- performing effectively by developing skills and selecting and using tactics, strategies and/or compositional ideas as a performer and/or coach
- developing and implementing a personal training activity by analysing needs, planning, monitoring and reflecting
- thinking critically and reflectively about their own performance and practice, and that of others.

The unit will be assessed via practical non-examination assessment. This unit must be taken in the final year of the course. There will be three parts to this assessment:

- 1. Perform in one sport or physical activity from the approved list (20% of qualification)
- 2. Perform in a second sport or physical activity **or** provide coaching in a sport or physical activity from the approved list (20% of qualification)
- 3. Plan, implement and evaluate a personal training activity (of self) over 8-10 weeks for a sport or physical activity from the approved list (20% of qualification)

Performance in a sport or physical activity must be assessed in a full and competitive context.

Learners who select coaching for Part 2 can be assessed in the same or different sport or physical activity from the approved list as that selected for Part 1.

For Part 3, learners can be assessed in the same or different sport or physical activity from the approved list as that selected for Part 1 and/or Part 2.

## Opportunities for integration of learning experiences

GCSE Physical Education and Health generates opportunities for the following learning experiences to be developed (experiences will not be directly assessed):

- create opportunities for themselves and others to develop health and wellbeing through a variety of sports and physical activities
- visit sporting facilities within Learners' local communities
- research sports participation initiatives and opportunities in Learners' local communities
- explore professional, semi-professional and career opportunities within related sectors. As an example, this could include engaging with, or watching recordings of sportspeople, coaches, officials and referees to understand their experiences of sports participation, coaching and officiating
- officiate in appropriate activities to further enhance their understanding of the rules and laws of the activity
- make appropriate use of digital technology.

The Guidance for Teaching will include further information on the opportunities provided by the qualification for teachers/centres to integrate these learning experiences and skills into delivery.

For opportunities to develop cross-cutting themes, cross-curricular skills and integral skills please see [Appendix B.](#page-31-0) the Guidance for Teaching will include further information on the opportunities provided by the qualification for teachers/centres to integrate these learning experiences into delivery

## 3.2 Arrangements for non-examination assessment

### Unit 2: Overview

This assessment will include three parts:

- 1. Perform in one sport or physical activity from the approved list (20% of qualification)
- 2. Perform in a second sport or physical activity **or** provide coaching in a sport or physical activity from the approved list (20% of qualification)
- 3. Plan, implement and evaluate a personal training activity (of self) over 8-10 weeks for a sport or physical activity from the approved list (20% qualification)

Learners who select coaching for Part 2 can be assessed in the same or different sport or physical activity from the approved list as that selected for Part 1.

For Part 3, learners can be assessed in the same or different sport or physical activity from the approved list as that selected for Part 1 and/or Part 2.

Physical activities/sports can be off-site. Off-site activities are those that do not take place at the centre and/or cannot be performed live at the centre.

Any off-site activities that do not take place at the centre and where it would be difficult to moderate "live" on moderation day, must have appropriate audio-visual evidence. This evidence is subject to the visiting moderator as is any other activity.

Tasks are externally set. Tasks and assessment criteria will remain the same for the lifetime of the qualification.

Assessment must be marked by the Centre and moderated by a WJEC visiting moderator.

Appropriate audio-visual evidence must be available for the performance of any candidate that cannot be seen 'live' on moderation day.

Each part will be marked out of a total of 40 marks. The unit will be marked out of a total of 120 marks.

# 4 MALPRACTICE

Before the course starts, the teacher is responsible for informing candidates of WJEC's regulations concerning malpractice. Candidates must not take part in any unfair practice in the preparation of work for GCSE Physical Education and Health.

Information regarding malpractice is available in our [Guide to preventing, reporting and](https://www.wjec.co.uk/media/0pjats1l/guide-to-preventing-reporting-and-investigating-malpractice-april-2022-002.pdf)  [investigating malpractice.](https://www.wjec.co.uk/media/0pjats1l/guide-to-preventing-reporting-and-investigating-malpractice-april-2022-002.pdf)

All cases of suspected or actual malpractice must be reported immediately to WJEC (malpractice@wjec.co.uk). If candidates commit malpractice, they may be penalised or disqualified from the examinations.

In all cases of malpractice, centres are advised to consult the JCQ booklet [Suspected](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice)  [Malpractice: Policies and Procedures.](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice)

# 5 TECHNICAL INFORMATION

<span id="page-26-1"></span>

## 5.1 Making entries

This is a linear qualification in which all assessments must be taken at the end of the course. The non-examination assessment for Unit 2 can be completed earlier in the course but must be submitted at the end of the course. The non-examination assessment for Unit 2 must be submitted during the assessment window set by WJEC in the final year of study.

Assessment opportunities will be available in the summer series until the end of the life of this specification. Summer 2028 will be the first assessment opportunity.

A qualification may be taken more than once.

Marks for non-examination assessment (NEA) may be carried forward for the life of the specification. If a candidate resits an NEA unit (rather than carrying forward the previous NEA mark), it is the new mark that will count towards the overall grade, even if it is lower than a previous attempt (unless the mark is absent).

The entry codes appear below:

| WJEC GCSE Physical Education and<br>Health | Entry code     |              |

## Accessibility and Inclusion:

In addition to the specialist activities that feature on the approved list (such as Boccia and Goalball), any of the other sports or physical activities can be adapted or adjusted as long as the adaptation or adjustment does not compromise the rigour and validity of the assessment.

Examples of adapted sports or physical activities include:

| Blind Cricket         | Blind Football     | Polybat                 |
|-----------------------|--------------------|-------------------------|
| Powerchair Football   | Sitting Volleyball | Table Cricket           |
| Wheelchair Basketball | Wheelchair Rugby   | Wheelchair Table Tennis |
| Wheelchair Tennis     |                    |                         |

Learners without a disability can be assessed in specialist and adapted sports and physical activities, for example wheelchair rugby, as long as doing so does not compromise the rigour and validity of the assessment, or unfairly advantage or disadvantage one learner over another.

{31}------------------------------------------------

#### GCSE PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND HEALTH 30

If a learner is assessed in the performance of an adapted sport or physical activity they cannot also be assessed in performance of the non-adapted version of the same sport or physical activity.

Learners can perform in the adapted or non-adapted version of the sport or physical activity and coach in the adapted or non-adapted version of the sport or physical activity.
