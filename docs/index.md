# WJEC Document Proofreader

This project aims to expose what can only be described as criminal levels of ineptitude at the WJEC. 

The WJEC is the national exam board for Wales, and all state schools **must** use it for their GCSEs and A-Levels. This has clearly bred a level of complacency that has now reached entirely unacceptable levels. 

To do this, I have created a tool which scraped all of the WJEC's 'Made for Wales' GCSE documents and performed a series of proofreading checks on them, starting with by running a basic spellcheck (which hasn't been done by the WJEC) and finished by running an LLM-powered, line-by-line proofreading check.
