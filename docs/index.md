# WJEC Copyediting Results

This site provides a tabbed, shareable view of the copyediting analyses for the WJEC "Made for Wales" GCSE documents. Use the tabs above to jump between methodology, data notes, and rendered notebooks.

Key points:
- The rendered notebooks in the Notebooks tab are executed in CI on every push to `master`.
- You can open and run the source notebooks locally from the `notebooks/` folder for deeper exploration.
- Data summaries will expand as the categorised dataset becomes available.
