# Issue Categories

To keep things consistent, easy to filter and easy to understand, all issues found during the proofreading process were categorised into the following error types:

## Parsing Error

Errors caused by the conversion from PDF to scanned text. These are typically garbled text that emerged when the PDF was converted to a readable format.
  - *What this means:* Missing or jumbled letters that make words look odd, like `Oueen` instead of `Queen`, or words fused together. These errors are a result of imperfect digital conversion, not actual mistakes in the original document.

## Spelling Error

Words that are spelled incorrectly or don't match British English conventions (since these are UK exam documents).
  - *What this means:* Typos or non-standard spellings, such as `definately` instead of `definitely`, or `Malcom` instead of `Malcolm`. These are genuine spelling mistakes.

## Grammatical Error

Clear breaks in sentence structure and grammar rules that are wrong in any context.

  - *What this means:* Missing words, incorrect word order, or wrong verb forms that make a sentence confusing or incorrect. For example, `collective highly qualified authors` (missing a verb), or `therefore, That...` (incorrect capitalisation mid-sentence).
Consistency
## Consistency Error

The text is correct on its own, but contradicts how the same thing is written elsewhere in the documents.
  - *What this means:* The document uses the same term or phrase in two different ways—like calling something both "war communism" and "war Communism" in different places. It could also mean using a wordy phrase like "due to the fact that" when "because" is used elsewhere.

## Ambiguous Phrasing

The sentence is technically correct, but the meaning is unclear or could be misunderstood.
  - *What this means:* Confusing sentence structure that makes it hard to understand who or what the sentence is about. For example: "Faced with the potential of radical elements, the demands were met..." could imply that the demands were facing the elements, rather than the government.

## Stylistic Preference

These are suggestions from `Language Tool` or the LLM where the phrasing could be improved for clarity, professionalism, or tone, even though it's not technically wrong.

  - *What this means:* The text works but could be better. This only applies when the current wording genuinely makes the text harder to understand or sounds awkward. Minor preference changes (like "how we assess" vs. "assessment methodology") do not count.

## Factual Inaccuracy

Statements or terminology that are objectively false or incorrect.

  - *What this means:* A factually wrong claim or misnamed term. For example, referring to Lenin's "April Theses" as the "April Thesis" (wrong name).

## False Positive

Issues flagged by the tools that are not actually errors and require no correction.
  - *What this means:* The tools mistakenly flagged something as wrong when it's actually correct. This includes technical terminology, proper nouns, valid UK English conventions, or structural elements (like header echoes or table formatting) that don't need fixing.
